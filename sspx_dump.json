(Given that it has a guest house beside the chapel.) The SSPX priests have been celebrating TLMs in unusual places like funeral homes, considering this option would help them, how much would they need in order to sustain celebrating TLMs more regularly (instead of every other week)? They have to travel approximately 250km.\n3.

The SSPX stayed and continues to grow. Virtually the only TLM offered aside from a couple of sede priests and some private hidden diocesan latin masses I hear rumors about. \n2. Depends on many factors, but early founding SSPX missions in Latin America usually begin with private masses held in people's living rooms. The first chapel here was held in a private property, not owned by SSPX. Still is, proper chapel still hasn't begun construction. \n3. No, Bishops can't interfere, these are private domiciles."

In the case of those who have never heard about Christianity, how can their salvation depend upon faith + baptism? Denying them salvation seems to be punishing them for something that is beyond their control.\n\nThe writer is making an error here in equating damnation with punishment. In fact, due to original sin, human beings are all born without the right to Heaven. For this reason, damnation is the default condition of human souls and not a punishment. This has been well understood for centuries, if not millennia. e.g. Dante placing the souls of virtuous pagans in the first circle of Hell.\n\nWhen we speak of justice, we are concerned with whether someone has, or has not, attained that to which they have a right. If I have a right to something, but that thing is denied me, we call that injustice. If I don't have a right to something, and that thing is denied me, we don't call that injustice. So to say that is \"unjust\" for those who have never heard of Christianity to be refused Heaven is like saying that it is unjust for kindergarten children to be turned away at the polling station or the liquor store.\n\nIt is baptism that gives us the right to Heaven. The unbaptized therefore have no right to Heaven, and their damnation is therefore not unjust.\n\nOk, so if the damnation of those who are unbaptized through no fault of their own is not unjust, is it nonetheless somehow \"punishing them for something that is beyond their control\"? Well, the Church teaches that all persons will receive their due reward or their due punishment, and that the degree of reward or punishment depends on what the person has done during their life. Although an unbeliever may not attain Heaven, it does not necessarily follow that they suffer torments in Hell. We can imagine a \"virtuous unbeliever\", who did his best to follow the natural law, and did penance for his failures having little or no pains of sense in Hell, much as we can imagine the unbaptized infants -- although not enjoying the beatific vision and therefore technically damned -- existing in a state of natural bliss."

    "selftext": "1. The New Mass and the Destruction of Faith\n\nThe Holy Mass is the source and summit of the life of the Church (Council of Trent, De Sacrificio Missae). If the source is corrupted, the entire spiritual life of a Christian is endangered.\n\nSt. Pius X taught that the liturgy shapes faith: ‚ÄúLex orandi ‚Äì lex credendi‚Äù (the law of prayer is the law of belief).\n\nThe New Mass (Novus Ordo Missae, 1969) was deliberately ‚Äúde-Protestantized,‚Äù meaning it was stripped of numerous elements expressing the sacrificial nature of the Mass, while the emphasis was shifted toward the communal meal and fellowship.\n\nAs a result, the faithful began to see the Mass not as the Sacrifice of Calvary, but as a gathering and shared meal. This leads to the loss of Catholic faith in the Real Presence and the sacrificial character of the Eucharist.\n\n\n---\n\n2. Mass Apostasy\n\nMore than half a century has passed since the introduction of the New Mass. The statistics are clear:\n\nA dramatic decline in priestly and religious vocations.\n\nEmpty seminaries and monasteries.\n\nMillions of Catholics in Europe and America leaving for sects, atheism, or complete indifference.\n\n\nPope Pius XII warned that ‚Äúwhen the liturgy is distorted, the faith of the faithful weakens and perishes‚Äù (Mediator Dei). This is exactly what happened ‚Äì through the deformation of the Mass, the process of spiritual denationalization of Catholics began.\n\n\n---\n\n3. Pentecostalization of the Church\n\nThe impoverished New Mass, stripped of majesty and the sacred, created a vacuum.\n\nIn place of silence, adoration, and the sacred, emotionalism, guitar songs, clapping, and spontaneous prayers emerged.\n\nThis opened the way to charismatic spirituality ‚Äì that is, Protestant pentecostalization.\n\nCatholics, finding no mystery or sacrifice in the Novus Ordo, began seeking ‚Äúreligious experiences,‚Äù ‚Äúemotional uplift,‚Äù or the ‚Äúpower of the Spirit,‚Äù often imitating Pentecostal patterns.\n\nAs early as 1976, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger wrote that ‚Äúthe New Mass is the product of a committee, not the organic development of Tradition‚Äù and that it led to ‚Äúthe banalization of the liturgy.‚Äù This banalization opened the door to Protestantization and emotionalism.\n\n\n---\n\n4. Pre-Conciliar Warnings\n\nSt. Pius V, in the bull Quo Primum (1570), commanded that the Roman Mass should never be fundamentally changed.\n\nPius XII warned: ‚ÄúNo one, not even a priest, may dare to arbitrarily add, remove, or change anything in the liturgy‚Äù (Mediator Dei).\n\nLeo XIII taught that ‚Äúthe surest path to losing the faith is changing the public worship of the Church.‚Äù\n\nWhat the popes predicted came true precisely after Paul VI‚Äôs reform.\n\n\n---\n\n5. The Fruit of a Poisoned Tree\n\nThe New Mass was created by a commission led by Archbishop Annibale Bugnini, who collaborated with Protestant observers. Cardinal Ottaviani ‚Äì Prefect of the Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office ‚Äì wrote to Paul VI that the Novus Ordo, ‚Äúin its entire structure and individual parts represents a startling departure from the Catholic theology of the Mass formulated by the Council of Trent.‚Äù\n\nThe fruit of this ‚Äúnew rite‚Äù is:\n\nThe widespread disappearance of faith in the Real Presence (most faithful in the USA or Germany no longer believe in it).\n\nProfanation of the Eucharist through Communion in the hand.\n\nTreating the priest as the leader of the assembly rather than as the one offering the Host to God.\n\n\n\n---\n\n6. Summary\n\nThe New Mass is the root of the crisis:\n\nIt destroys faith because it changes the way it is professed.\n\nIt destroys the Church because it leads to empty seminaries and mass apostasy.\n\nIt opens the door to the spirit of Protestantism and emotional religiosity instead of to the Sacrifice of the Cross.\n\n\nFor this reason, the Society of St. Pius X has defended the Mass of All Time from the beginning as the only certain antidote to the crisis ‚Äì like an antibiotic that heals the source of the illness, not just the symptoms.\n\nFideles Traditionis Group",

This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. **They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity.** Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition.\n\nThis is continued in article 2359:\n\n>**Homosexual persons are called to chastity**. By the virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.\n\nSo for those people who have SSA, they are called to live a life of chastity, uniting their struggle with that of Our Lord's on the cross. This is no different to any person who is not SSA who also experiences lust or temptation to sin in a grave way.\n\nThe church cannot bless sin, but it can facilitate those of us, of which there are many, who are in a state of sin, a path to sacramental grace."

Now matter how wrong protestants are about theology, I miss how emotional and personal everything was.\n\nNow, the more I learn about theology, He seems more and more overwhelmingly abstract (we can literally not understand God as humans) and I feel like I don‚Äôt even know who I‚Äòm praying to anymore since God is so infinite and complicated. \n\nI‚Äòd even say I experience rather what‚Äôs called fide informis than fide formata. \n\nNo clue how to fix this feeling of detachment.\n\nDo you talk to God using your own words?

    "selftext": "\"Engaging in dialogue with error means placing God and the devil on the same level.\"\n‚Äì Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre\n\n\nThis statement by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre is strong and requires calm reflection. Let me explain it step by step:\n\n1. What is error?\nIn the Catholic understanding, error is falsehood opposed to the truth revealed by God. And revealed truth is Christ Himself, ‚Äúthe Way, the Truth, and the Life‚Äù (John 14:6). Therefore, error is not just an intellectual mistake, but something that opposes God.\n\n\n2. What is dialogue with error?\nIf someone tries to ‚Äúdialogue‚Äù with error on equal terms‚Äîthat is, treating falsehood and truth as equally valid positions‚Äîthen in practice he gives falsehood the rank of truth. This is dangerous, because it makes one behave as if one could choose between God and Satan as between two opinions.\n\n\n3. Why does Lefebvre speak about ‚Äúplacing God and the devil on the same level‚Äù?\n\nGod is the source of truth.\n\nThe devil, from the beginning, is the ‚Äúfather of lies‚Äù (John 8:44).\nIf one accepts that truth and falsehood can be discussed and negotiated as equals, then one is treating God and the devil as if they were equal ‚Äúpartners at the table.‚Äù In other words: giving the devil a place equal to God.\n\n\n\n4. Practical consequences\n\nA Christian has no right to treat error as something that can serve as a basis for compromise.\n\nDialogue with a person in error‚Äîyes, because we must help him reach the truth. But dialogue with error itself‚Äîno, because truth cannot negotiate with falsehood.\n\nWithin the Church, Lefebvre‚Äôs statement was directed against the idea of ‚Äúinterreligious dialogue‚Äù and ‚Äúecumenism‚Äù understood as putting all religions on the same level. In his view, such an attitude meant a betrayal of the exclusivity of Christ‚Äôs truth.\n\n\n\n5. For us personally\nThis sentence is a call to vigilance:\n\nthat we should not try to ‚Äúreconcile‚Äù sin with grace in our hearts,\n\nthat we should not consider every opinion or ideology as equally good as the Catholic faith,\n\nthat we should have the courage to stand on the side of truth, even when it is difficult.",

Amen.\n\nOffering of the Chaplet:\nMost Sorrowful Mother, I offer You this Chaplet in honor of Your Most Holy Sorrows endured on earth; in thanksgiving for the graces You have obtained for me through them from God; and to implore, through the merits of those same Sorrows, the graces which You know and see to be most necessary for my soul, and especially the grace of Your most special protection at the hour of my death. Amen.\nMost Sorrowful Mother, grant that I may accompany You in the Sorrows of the Death of Jesus Christ.\n\n\n---\n\nFIRST SORROW üñ§ The Prophecy of Simeon\n\nO Mary, Sorrowful Mother! I grieve with You for the first sword which pierced Your Heart when the aged Simeon in the Temple foretold to You all the outrages of the Passion which Your Beloved Jesus was to endure from men, and which You, Mother, foresaw and understood. By this dreadful vision which so tormented Your Heart, I beg You, O my most merciful Lady! obtain for me this grace: that all throughout my life and at my death I may ever keep deeply engraved in my heart both Your Sorrows and the Passion of Jesus, Your Son.\n1 x Our Father\n7 x Hail Mary\n\n\n---\n\nSECOND SORROW üñ§ The Flight into Egypt\n\nO Mary, Sorrowful Mother! I grieve with You for the second sword which pierced Your Heart, when seeing Your innocent Son scarcely born, already persecuted and sought unto death by those whom He came to save, You were compelled to flee secretly by night into Egypt. By the fear, hardships, and labors which You endured in the company of the Infant Jesus, Your Son, during that long and weary journey through unknown lands, and by Your dwelling as a stranger in Egypt, poor and humiliated, I beg You, O most gracious Lady, obtain for me patience in enduring the hardships and adversities of this wretched life, that I may thereby escape the eternal pains of hell, which by my sins I have deserved.\n1 x Our Father\n7 x Hail Mary\n\n\n---\n\nTHIRD SORROW üñ§ The Loss of the Child Jesus in the Temple\n\nO Mary, Sorrowful Mother! I grieve with You for the third sword which pierced Your Heart when Your beloved Jesus, Your Son, remained in the Temple of Jerusalem for three days without Your knowledge. Not seeing near You Him Who was Your only Love, nor knowing the reason for His absence, You passed all that time without rest, and the nights without sleep, weeping and sighing for Him Who was Your only and supreme Good. By all those tears and that sorrow which You endured in those three most long and bitter days, obtain for me the grace never to lose my God, but always to live and die united to Him.\n1 x Our Father\n7 x Hail Mary\n\n\n---\n\nFOURTH SORROW üñ§ Meeting Jesus Carrying His Cross\n\nO Mary, Sorrowful Mother! I grieve with You for the fourth sword which pierced Your Heart when You beheld Your beloved Jesus, Your Son, condemned to an innocent and cruel death, bound with chains, covered with Blood and wounds, crowned with thorns, staggering beneath the weight of the Cross, led to die for us out of Love. Meeting Him on the way, You saw His holy Countenance disfigured, and that sight became a cruel sword piercing Your Heart and His Heart burning with love. By this incomprehensible sorrow, I beg You, obtain for me the grace of perfect resignation to the Will of God, and of bearing with patience and joy all trials and sufferings even to the end of my life.\n1 x Our Father\n7 x Hail Mary\n\n\n---\n\nFIFTH SORROW üñ§ The Death of Jesus on the Cross\n\nO Mary, Sorrowful Mother! I grieve with You for the fifth sword which pierced Your Heart on Mount Calvary, when You beheld the cruel death of Your beloved Jesus, Your Son, Who before Your eyes, in unspeakable pains, on the hard bed of the Cross, in the midst of mockery and derision, was dying. I beg You, most merciful Mother, by those mortal sorrows which You endured with Your dying Son, Who from the Cross for the last time addressed You, commending us to You as Your children, and then inclined His Head and gave up His Spirit into the Hands of the Eternal Father: obtain for me the grace from Your beloved Jesus, that I may henceforth die to all creatures and live only for God my Creator, and so at last attain to Heaven, there to praise and behold Him forever.\n1 x Our Father\n7 x Hail Mary\n\n\n---\n\nSIXTH SORROW üñ§ The Body of Jesus Placed in the Arms of His Mother\n\nO Mary, Sorrowful Mother! I grieve with You for the sixth sword which pierced Your Heart, when You saw the Heart of Your Son, so full of love for mankind, pierced through and through, after He had endured a most cruel and bitter death for their salvation, and even after death outraged by them. By this sorrow which so cruelly rent Your Heart, obtain for me the grace of dwelling in the Wound of the Heart of Jesus, pierced for me, that I may think of nothing but God and His mercy, love Him above all things, and keep His holy commandments.\n1 x Our Father\n7 x Hail Mary\n\n\n---\n\nSEVENTH SORROW üñ§ The Burial of Jesus\n\nO Mary, Sorrowful Mother! I grieve with You for the seventh sword which pierced Your Heart, when You beheld upon Your bosom the lifeless Body of Your beloved Son, taken down from the Cross, disfigured, covered with wounds and blood. At the sight You cried: ‚ÄúAh, dearest Son! To what has the love of men brought You?‚Äù And when He was borne to the sepulcher, You accompanied Him, desiring with Your own hands to lay Him in the tomb, and there, bidding farewell to Your Son Jesus, You laid also within it Your Heart overflowing with sorrows. By all these sorrows of Your Heart, O Mother of most pure Love, obtain for me forgiveness of all my sins, of which I repent with all my heart; defend me from every temptation, especially at the hour of my death, that through the merits of Jesus Christ and Your intercession I may enter Heaven, there to praise and glorify Jesus, Your Son, and You forever. Amen.\n1 x Our Father\n7 x Hail Mary\n\n\n---\n\nV. Pray for us, O Virgin most Sorrowful.\nR.

Amen.\n\nLet us pray:\nO Most Holy Mary, Most Sorrowful Mother, through the Seven Sorrows of Your Most Precious Heart, which I have desired to honor by the recitation of this chaplet, I humbly beg, entreat, and implore You: obtain for me the grace of rising from my sins, perseverance in the grace of God, preservation from even the least offense against Him, and in the hour of my death, come, O Mother of Mercy, come and receive my soul, which even now, and for that moment, and forever, I entrust and commend into Your hands.

    "selftext": "Hi\n\nI‚Äòm a 17 year old girl from a liberal-protestant family, but I‚Äòm genuinely curious about your worldview since I‚Äòm very interested in Catholicism.\n\nI‚Äòm struggling to understand what exactly you mind about feminism.\n\nI have a few questions:\n\n1. I‚Äòm sure you know about the waves of feminism: The first one (late 19th - early 20th century) focused mainly on the right to vote, to own property and to access education. I understand that you struggle with the later waves that focused on abortion, sexual freedom and LGBTQ, but what about early feminism that secured equal rights and freedom for women?\n\n2. Do you support women going to university or work? I get that you criticise if a woman values her career more than her family, but what if she‚Äôd study/work until she has children and once they leave, she can work again.\n\nMy mother did that; she had a career and was in a leading position, but when she had me, she stopped and only started to work again PART time when my sister and I were old enough to go to school (which is full day here).\n\nWhat‚Äôs the issue?\n\n3. Women refusing to get married‚Ä¶ When I hear terms like ‚Äûmale loneliness epidemic‚Äú and people talk about how no women want to settle anymore and choose to be single instead‚Ä¶ Why don‚Äôt men start asking themselves why women prefer working 9-5 and being alone over being with them? I know very few men/boys I‚Äòd be willing to live with for the rest of my life. When I look at the guys in my class, I see a bunch of sexist, lazy, immature and gaming-addicted boys who expect girls to do all the work. Fortunately, not all men are like that, but many are‚Ä¶ \n\nWhy would we choose to stay with someone like that? \n\nIs feminism bad for letting us choose who we want to be with and raise our kids with? For having standards (such as having a responsible, respectful partner)? Is feminism bad for letting us divorce a man who‚Äôs lazy, disrespectful or even abusive?\n\n4. It often sounds like feminism just appeared from nowhere or that communists created it or that it‚Äôs moral decay. I view it as the obvious reaction to the industrialisation:\n\nFriedrich Engels, a 19th century Marxist, noted that women's work in feudal societies was closely linked to the household. They grew food, wove fabrics and produced what the family needed. Legally, women were considered inferior, but their work was important and socially recognised.\n\nIndustrial capitalism changed this and factories took over production and workers were treated as commodities. Domestic labour no longer counted, even though women were still expected to take care of the household. At the same time, many were forced into wage labour. Capitalists profited from the fact that women provided cheap labour, while their unpaid housework, feeding, clothing and caring for the workforce kept the system running at no extra cost. This double exploitation meant that women were overburdened at home and at work. Feminism did not emerge as a random protest, but as a reaction to the injustice inherent in the system.\n\nI understand why traditionalists see disorder in modern life, and in many ways I agree with them. But I think the problem is liberal capitalism, which has destroyed the old balance and devalued labour, which has always been important.\n\nI listened to a talk by Gregorius Hesse about Liberalism and free masonry and I honestly very much agreed with him, but the average rTraditionalCatholicism user does NOT make Capitalism responsible for what‚Äôs going on (unfortunately I can‚Äôt post there)\n\n5. My last question is, what I‚Äòd be supposed to do if I was a trad cath. I‚Äòm 17, as I mentioned before, and my biggest interests are philosophy, history and art history. I don‚Äôt want to work as a nurse or a kindergarten teacher. I enjoy debates and writing essays. I don‚Äôt dislike children, but I can‚Äôt handle being around people all day, it drives me crazy. I‚Äòm not very emotional or romantic, but instead a very logical and rational person. I don‚Äôt feel the urge to have a family and am not really interested in romance or intimacy.\n\nDo I see myself as a housewife with three children in 10 years? Absolutely not. \n\nWhat‚Äôs your response to that?\n\n-\n\nI‚Äòd be really curious about hearing your thoughts. I‚Äòm absolutely open to changing my mind and noticed that I agree with many traditionalist views when I started getting into the topic. But I struggle with these few things.\n\nThank you :)",

        "body": "Hi, french trad cath here. Philosophy student, psychology therapist at the end of the year, one of my brothers and one of my uncles are priests in SSPX. US SSPX catholics tend to be influenced by protestantism, and therefore to be a bit more \"conservative\" on social issues than authentic catholicism. So take the answers with a good pinch of salt.\n\n[1] The problem isn't the right to vote or anything like that. Feminism has two major problems :\n- The fact that its goal is \"more freedome for women\" and not \"the greater good\". Tbh, the right to vote was 100% a good idea in terms of greater good, but the intentions behind feminism is rotten to it's core. Fighting for consent, women's right to vote, wage equality (when inequalities are real), and ending things that could reasonably be called \"rape culture\" (like blaming the foolish victims so much that you don't even condemn the perpetrators), are very good things, but feminism do so for bad reasons.\n- The last waves of feminism, because they want women's right and not the greater good, have progressively fought for objective wrongs like abortion and contraception. We could write more about that if you want.\n\n[2] All things equal, the more people are educated, the best. \"Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\" (John 8:32). The problem is that women's education is frequently motivated by the idea that women should be \"self sufficient\", whereas NOBODY is self sufficient. You'll always depend on your husband/spouse/parents, and furthermore one your fellow parishioners and co-workers. Education should be pursued for the greater good and because beauty and perfection of the mind is a good thing per se, not because it's a way to individualism.\n\n[3] You're globaly 100% right : modern males and females are not wedding material, so no male or female want to get married and everybody ends lonely. But because mariage in a non christian world is slavery of the woman to the man's desire (Leo XIII, Arcanum, 1880), the men are the first complaining about loneliness.\n\n[4] I myself am very much interested in catholic anticapitalism (Chesterton, Belloc, Mainvielle, Sarda y Salvany, Saint-Simon), and I 100% consider that capitalism is the main cause of the destruction of traditional family, with how the nobility used mariage during the middle age being the second cause. Trad caths are sometimes very reluctant to go full anticapitalism because, in the modern world, the alternative is communism, which is at least as false than economic liberalism (which is the ethic behind capitalism)\n\n[5] Very very interesting point. All humans have the same natural end, being animals : having children. But some lack natural ease to do so. The very question is : how could you be the most useful for the greater good. Being a good mother is the most obvious way as a woman, the same as being a good father is the most obvious way as a man. But it is best to be a good single doctor/scientific/other than a bad mother. So you should simply pray God for the strength to do as is best in His will : apparently, for now, mother doesn't seem the best for you (you're still a bit young, it could change, but let's say it won't), so maybe you'll end as a nun (could be very mystical, or teaching, or even studying theology or something else, as dominicans have always done), or something else like a uni teacher or anything else.\n\nEdit : Looking into your reddit history, I see that you seem to speak fluent german, are interested in dialectical materialism, and have already asked a question about women here, which I tried to give an answer that you seem to have been interested in. I'm very interested in marxism too, as it's my worst enemy, as a thomist. Marxism is the second most strong philosophy/worldview, behind thomism, sooo yeah I better know it. In short : you will have to choose between marxism and catholicism. Maybe read \"Divini Redemptoris\" (Pius XI, 1937) to get where catholicism is opposed, and then maybe learn a bit about thomism, starting with the 24 theses and Pascendi (Pius X, 1907), and after that, well, you'll be ready to take a look at Saint Thomas himself, or maybe through Ed Feser, or many other english thomist channels... Long story short : welcome to philosophy and theology sis."

        "body": "**Answer (2/2)**\n\n4. You are moving into intellectual areas with which I am unfamiliar. My sense is that, in general, traditional Catholics should not be ideological capitalists. Traditional Catholic social teaching is that the right to own property, and to buy and to sell, to gain profit from one's work is God-given, and therefore unassailable. However, that does not mean that the economic system of the USA is in conformity with Catholic social doctrine. Corporations and businessmen here seek to increase their own wealth without end, even when the result is the financial destruction of their own workers and associates. I am reminded of a scene in the movie \"The Founder\" about the beginning of the McDonald's hamburger restaurant chain. In this scene, Ray Kroc, the \"founder\" of the McDonald's corporation explains to the McDonald brothers, from whom he has wrested control of the business, that his approach to business is such, that if he saw a drowning man (his competitor in business), instead of saving him, he would put more water in his mouth to drown him more quickly. It is apparent that this attitude is immoral.\n\nYou might be interested in some of the writings of Pope Leo XIII on this topic. They are from the late 19th century, but still relevant:\n\n[https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf\\_l-xiii\\_enc\\_15051891\\_rerum-novarum.html](https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum.html)\n\n[https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf\\_l-xiii\\_enc\\_28121878\\_quod-apostolici-muneris.html](https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_28121878_quod-apostolici-muneris.html)\n\n5. You have no obligation to marry. You are free to pursue your interests. You might wish to marry at a later time or, having completed your studies, enter a religious order, or simply remain single. You should remember, however, that our goal on Earth is to know, love, and serve God as best we can, and whatever we choose to do in life, it should primarily serve this purpose. If some other person were to criticize you for your life choices (assuming that you are not living a life of sin) then it is best to simply ignore them. You are obviously an intelligent young woman and I wish you the best."

        "body": "**Answer (1/2)**\n\nHi. I think you have already gotten some good answers, but I will give you my perspective. Unfortunately, unlike u/craft00n, I have not studied philosophy so please consider my answers to be coming from my instinct rather than from knowledge of traditional Cathollic philosophy and theology. You should also know that I am American and I have daughters around your age, two already at university, one still in school.\n\nIch habe vier Jahren in Deutschland gelebt und dort die deutsche Sprache erlernt. Ich kann also Deutsch sehr gut lesen. Weil aber mein Aufenthalt in Deutschland vor 20 Jahren beendet worden ist und ich mich kaum noch mit der deutschen Sprache besch√§ftige, ist meine Schreibfertigkeit etwas nachgelassen. Daher schreibe ich lieber auf Englisch, damit ich nicht allzu lange Zeit verbringe, und nicht allzu viele Fehler der Grammatik und Rechtschreibung machen. Okay?\n\n1. As I said, I have two daughters already in university, so I have no problem with women studying at university. I am in favor of women receiving education, if they wish, and of women having the right to own property. I will tell you that among traditional Catholics in the USA, there are many whose daughters do not go to university, but also many of their sons do not go to university, even if the father and mother did attend university. I think this is because these families do not wish to send their children to secular universities (which are, indeed, awful in many ways), but there are few good Catholic universities, and they are expensive.\n\nAs far as voting goes, I like to tell my children that democracy is not a Catholic value. By that, I do not mean that I dislike democracy, but rather that, for Catholics the system of government is less important than the nature of government. Catholics should desire a confessional state. That is, a state in which the government is explicitly Catholic in confession, and the government and Church work together harmoniously to build a Catholic society. Of course we Catholics may not accomplish this by violence, but rather by conversion of the people. Whether the political system in this state is a democracy, a constitutional monarchy, an absolute monarchy, etc. is less important than the fact that the society and government are Catholic.\n\nHaving said that, since we do live in a democracy, Catholics (both men and women) should vote and, in principle, I am not opposed to women voting. However, I do think that husbands and wives (assuming both are Catholic) should agree among themselves for whom they will vote and both should cast their votes for the same candidates.\n\n2. I do not oppose wives working outside the home when there are no children, or if it is a matter of true financial necessity (not the necessity to go on holiday, but the necessity to pay the rent). When there are children, however, it is best for the mother to be at home to take care of the children. Even when the children go to school, I don't think it is a wise idea to allow them to come home to an empty house.\n\n3. You are absolutely correct about the problems we see among the youth. It is no surprise to me that young women are not interested in marrying young men who act like small children and who display no maturity. It is very important, in my opinion, for Catholic parents to make sure that their children do not fall into the trap of extended immaturity, and other specific vices such as addition to porn, gaming, tiktok-doomscrolling, etc. Therefore, I do not allow my children to access the internet without supervision until they go to university (where I can not supervise them in any case). Of course this also means that they may not possess a smartphone. We also have no television in the house. Nonetheless, my children are permitted to watch some TV shows, and some movies, and I try to expose them in a limited manner to pop culture and the wider society. I do not want my children to get out \"into the world\" and think that I have been keeping them trapped in a Catholic bubble. Children who are kept from all secular influences while growing up often experience a crisis of faith, or lose their faith entirely, when they finally leave their parents' home.\n\nThe other point you mentioned that I want to address is divorce. The Catholic church teaches that marriage is indissoluble. Once a man and woman are validly joined in holy matrimony, there is no possibility of divorce. It can happen that a woman marries a man who (presumably later) turns out to be lazy, or treats his wife disrespectfully. That is a problem, but divorce is not an acceptable (or a possible) answer. In some cases of abuse the Church does allow separation, but separation is not divorce, and it is not possible for either the husband or wife to find a new partner after the separation. Indeed, they should still cooperate in raising their children,  and be willing to live together again if the problem that caused the separation is overcome."

        "body": "Others have given great answers but I thought I'll add my own two cents if it helps.\n\n1. Feminism itself has fundamentally unchristian beginnings. I'd suggest reading \"The End of Woman: How Smashing the Patriarchy has Destroyed Us\" by Carrie Gress along with more of her books on the subject. I think you will find it quite interesting. In a nutshell, at least the way I understood, feminism is correlated with dechristianisation of the west as gender roles began to lose their foundation as there was no logical or philosophical reason, at least one that was objectively grounded, to maintain them. Feminism, at its core, sought to make women the same as men and early feminists despised housewives, and marriage in general, as they saw it only as enslaving of women. Most, if not all, of early feminists were divorced promiscuous women, which are not good fruits to be judged by. Ultimately, since they have removed God from the equation, marriage became enslavement instead of a mutual self-giving rooted in love.\n2. It is not wrong for women to work or study period. However, as you said, she cannot value her career more than her family, as her primary duties lie in the latter. I feel like the following verse is applicable as well: \"For where thy treasure is, there is thy heart also.\" (Mt. 6:21). Most women, like most men, have historically always worked, and the way I see it is that the question really is trying to ask if women can work outside the home, which also is not fundamentally wrong, though not ideal. As u/Willsxyz said, you do not want children to come back to an empty house. But even children aside, the woman cannot really be a good wife while also working full-time outside the home, at least it seems too strenuous to me to do without good reason.\n3. Very valid issue, both men and women in the younger generations, to which I also belong, predominantly do not possess the qualities that would make them good partners. Most young people in the west have no care in the world, and if we are talking about non-religious then it is virtually hopeless, and it is similar in modern Catholic circles too. I have met quite a few decent men and women in Traditional Catholic circles though, so that's where I would suggest to look. I have heard it is a common trope among radical conservatives that women should do all the work, you know the redpill nonsense, but it has nothing to do with Catholic gender roles so if you ever want to find a good man to marry, he should be a good Catholic to  treat you well.\n4. You are exactly right with your observation that women were overburdened with work and household duties, however, I do not think it is necessarily an issue which resulted from industrialisation as much as it is a feminist issue at its core. Correct me if I'm wrong, but feminists fought for the right to work, and then realised it is extremely arduous to be a wife, mother and employee at once (as I mentioned in the answer to paragraph 2), but unwilling to let go of the work, the alternative being enslavement and dependance on their husbands, they began outsourcing the wifehood and motherhood to other women whom they would also employ, which is an issue remaining to this day. You say domestic labour no longer counted, but to whom? Do you think good husbands did not appreciate and value their wives' work? That the capitalist machine which seeks to extract all the bit of monetary value out of every individual did not value the output of a mother is wrong on every level and this is where I think is what as Catholics we need to do to change the world for the better. Capitalist, in essence, is not evil, as it is merely an economic model, but unchecked Capitalism is. The governments must place restrictions on Capitalism in their countries in order to ensure the tool works for the benefit of the nation that the benefit of the few at their expense. I will admit I am not well-versed in economic theories, so I cannot provide a detailed answer as to how things should be, but following the guidelines in Pope Leo XIII's encyclical Rerum Novarum would be a good start.\n5. You don't have to confine yourself to be a nurse or a kindergarten teacher. Considering your age, I'd suggest pursue your faith first and foremost, do follow what you are passionate about, and perhaps in a few years you will find a man who shares your interests whom you will want to marry. Since you lack much of an interest in romance as of now, if that remains, you may consider religious life, as someone else here mentioned. You could pursue your passions and dedicate your life to the ultimate good which is God, while also not having to be around people all the time. In any case, you need to grow in your faith and with time the right decision will seem clearer to you. May God bless you and guide you in your searching for answers."

Saints like Catherine of Siena & Teresa of √Åvila were educated and their writings influenced theology, philosophy, and even both secular and papal politics. For much of history, religious life was actually the best chance a woman had at pursuing higher education and devoting herself to study and teaching. Think about it, even those orders that do nursing and teaching require education for those roles and Dominican orders especially have study and preaching is part of their charism and often include an in-depth study of theology, including for women.\n\nAs the other responder pointed out, a lot of what is labeled traditionalism in America is very influence by fundamentalist and evangelical religion, which is very influenced by right-wing politics and often a disordered obsession with gender roles as interpreted through the lens of of a modernist and ultimately Calvinistic view of patriarchy (I know that last part sounds counterintuitive but Calvin's blends of secular philosophy and political thought with religion was part of the early modern movement which set the groundwork for modernism).\n\nMany of these guys would make the same mistakes regarding gender roles that communists and hardcore socialists make regarding the place of economics and materialism in social thought and, making that error and giving those things primacy above religious and interior life, would have probably condemned many women who have been canonized or have otherwise lived pious lives that sought to advocate for the greater good through education and influenced and sometimes even challenged religious and secular authorities."

At this sound, wherever one was‚Äîwhether in a house, a field, or on the road‚Äîpeople immediately knelt.\n\nKneeling was often done on bare ground, on pavement, in mud, or in snow, regardless of the conditions. Men removed their head coverings, women bowed with great humility. Even passersby and travelers, as soon as they heard the bell and saw the priest carrying the ciborium with the Blessed Sacrament, knelt in adoration.\n\nIn an instant, at the sound of this small bell, the entire village or town would transform into a silent church. Respect, silence, and piety reigned‚Äîeveryone knew that Christ himself, hidden in the Host, was passing by at that moment.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas:\n\"In this Sacrament, Christ himself is present, true God and true Man; therefore, there is no act of worship that we do not owe to Him.\" (Summa Theologiae, III, q. 75, a. 1)\n2.

Furthermore, those in mortal sin must seek perfect contrition, and good works help us in this quest."

Probably ask your grandmother what she and her mother and grandmother covered their heads with at Mass. You mention silk scarves or hats, those are fine things to wear to Mass and there's nothing wrong with it. If you don't have it then wear whatever you have. Something is better than nothing.\n\nI wouldn't worry about standing out.

Lord, they have slain thy prophets. They have torn down thy altars. But how does God answer him? I have left 7,000 men that have not bowed their knee to Baal.\n\nEven so then at this present time also there is a remnant selected out of grace. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Hhost. Amen. Dear reverend father dear brothers and sisters, dear faithful just a few days ago we celebrated the feast of the venerable patron St. Pius the 10th and I want to speak on the situation in the church today and on the foundation of our beloved society by Archbishop Lefebvre in response to this present crisis.\n\nSt. Paul says that the things of the Old Testament were written as an example for us for our instruction and correction. So follow this analogy, if you can, that I've made just between the history of the Old Testament kingdom of Israel and Judah and the comparison it bears with the New Testament kingdom of the Catholic Church centered in the papacy in Rome. So first we'll look at the Old Testament history.\n\nSo after many years of a unified rule that began under King David and lasted until the death of King Solomon, that's when the northern tribes of Israel started to break from the true worship that was in Jerusalem. And they started a false religion, a new worship that included some elements of the true worship, but they mixed it with pagan idolatrous symbols as well, such as the golden calf. And soon these tribes were deported and dispersed amongst all the nations because of their false beliefs and practices.\n\nAnd of course, the true worship continued in the kingdom of Judah, in the city of Jerusalem, in the temple, until a new syncretic religion was developed that combined true elements with false doctrine, which led to an invasion from foreign lands and the deportation of God's people into Babylon. The holy city was left in ruins. The temple was destroyed. The altar of sacrifice was desecrated. The holy vessels necessary for the true worship were stolen. And it was only the severely persecuted prophet Jeremias and a few of the most insignificant people that remained in Jerusalem. because the vast majority including the king and his whole royal house and most of the priesthood were carried away like the wind so that no official or solemn worship could be lawfully practiced until the time of punishment was completed. And then so we see after 70 years of captivity, their descendants, because that first generation passed away in captivity, their descendants began to return back to Jerusalem. The city was rebuilt and the true worship was started again and flourished.\n\nSo in my analogy which is obviously not de fide, okay, it's just my observation one can see though a true correlation between Protestant northern Europe breaking from the Catholic Church and being carried away in every direction with strange doctrine and worship while the true worship continued in Rome. But then we could see in the 1960s we see a new religion start to emerge after the council involving the priesthood, the prelets of the church, even involving the popes. The churches were liturgically vandalized in the name of the council, sacred vessels and vestments were thrown out. The sacrifice is desacralized with the novus ordo mass. It's no longer sacred and most of the clergy are carried away into doctrines and worship that are foreign to the traditional Catholic faith."

        "body": "**Continuation of transcription (2/3)**\n\nAnd so we should be very thankful for his excellency Marcel Lefebvre to have the prophetic insight to see what was happening in the church back in the 1960s and 1970s and to take a stand against the changes with a preference for what the church has always believed and taught and practiced and against all these novelties and change which, by the way, are code words for the communist and the modernist. And so he preferred to be firmly attached to eternal Rome instead of being carried away by every wind of doctrine of the day. So let us recall for a moment the reasons why Archbishop Lefebvre named the newly founded religious order after Pope St. Pius 10th. It was a calculated, deliberate and a prayerful choice. I will give you three reasons.\n\nWell, first the archbishop explained that since the purpose of the society of St. Pius the 10th is all the works necessary for the formation of the priest. The seminaries must ensure that priestly formation achieve its main goal which is priestly holiness. So the society was placed under the patronage of St. Pius the 10th because his primary concern as pope was the integrity the integrity of the priesthood and the sanctity that flowed from it. So as the priest goes so do the faithful. When the priest is holy the people will generally be holy as well.\n\nThe second reason, another reason for the name, the present crisis that has poisoned the church since the second Vatican council is the neo-modernist heresy, the synthesis of all heresies and the various secular philosophies that St. Pius the 10th viewed as being incompatible with Catholic dogma. So both he and the archbishop promoted thomistic scholastic theology as the principle philosophical method to be taught which is the antidote for all the poison that is being spewed by these so-called doctors who as St. Pius the 10th said \"although they know many things they don't know anything\".\n\nAnd then third finally since all the self-inflicted destruction that has occurred in the church over the last decade it made good sense to keep with the motto of his pontificate which is to restore all things in Christ.\n\nBut as we know, the ideas at the heart of liberalism and modernism did find their way into the church and flourished in the aftermath of the council and the council with its application and its interpretation and now virtually dominates the whole entire Catholic world. And the church authorities demand adherence to these new beliefs in the manner of the Pharisees who would throw anyone out of the synagogue if they professed belief that Jesus was the Messiah.\n\nSince faith is a supernatural virtue and thus greater than the moral virtue of obedience, the archbishop had to say no. And he describes this act as true obedience by saying, \"Now our disobedience is motivated by the need to keep the Catholic faith. And to be forced to submit to the second Vatican council to the postconcilary reforms, to the acts which are undermining our faith and destroying the church... It is impossible for us to do so. To collaborate in the destruction of the church is to betray the church and to betray our Lord Jesus Christ. So all the great theologians of the past have taught that if the pope by his acts destroys the church, we are not to obey him.\""

        "body": "**Continuation of transcription (3/3)**\n\nAnd so this is where we find ourselves today. The Catholic Church which has existed for almost two millennia is being replaced by another religion filled with contempt for the sacred and which bears the stamp of vulgarity which will only lead to further lead to the loss of faith and to atheism. The new theology is a syncretistic mixture of socialism and Christianity. And the only real true solution to end this crisis is the same as it was then to return back to the true faith of our fathers and to holiness. And no one can do this without God's grace and without the imitation of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nSo, one last story. Just a few weeks ago, the society of St. Pius the 10th gathered together over 7,000 pilgrims in Rome for the Jubilee year. They they assembled for mass only a few steps away from the Colosseum where thousands of mortars shed their blood for our Lord Jesus Christ. And just as today, in reminiscence of the pantheon of ancient Rome, where everything was tolerated and no false religion was left out, just as long as everyone agreed to burn a few simple grains of incense to all the gods. But the first Christians said no. They would not compromise the truth for a false peace. They would not they would rather lose their life for the true faith in Jesus Christ than to accommodate to the world and to the intolerance that it has for the truth and for the rights of God and for the kingship of our Lord Jesus Christ. And so here we are again today, 2,000 years later, to bear witness to that same faith. The faith that conquered the world, the faith that overcame paganism.\n\nOur superior general, Father Pagarani, in his sermon asked this question during that mass. What do we ask of the church and of its hierarchy? We demand the faith. This faith does not take as its mission to conform to the world and to dialogue with it but to convert it to the true and only savior our lord Jesus Christ. We will not bow our knee to Baal. We will not offer incense to the false religions of this world. And this is what we want to bear to those in the Vatican. We want this faith to be pro professed in its entirety. It is this faith that made the lepers well in today's gospel.\n\nThe city of Rome has been invaded, occupied, pillaged, burned many times, but it always seems to rise again. And so can the church because it is divinely founded by our Lord who could restore it even if it's even at a period of 70 years, which we're even coming close to that in just a few years. You figure the 1960s to about 2030, that's about 70 years. And the this can even coincide with the anniversary of the 2,000-year anniversary of our savior's passion and resurrection from the dead. So maybe we could see in our lifetimes the church rising out of its ashes as well. We can only hope and pray and just let events run their course according to divine providence. I'll close with a verse here from the Athanasian creed:\n\n\"Whoever wishes to be saved, it is necessary above all that he hold to the Catholic faith. Which faith, unless it is kept whole and undefiled, without a doubt, he will most surely perish. This is the Catholic faith which unless a man believes it faithfully and firmly, he cannot be saved.\"\n\nIn the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen."

And of course, it‚Äôs the same Mass just with more parts audible which helps you understand where you are in the Mass, which makes it easier to understand the structure.  Once you know where the Kyrie, Gloria, Gospel, Credo, Preface, Sanctus, Pater Noster, Agnes Dei, Communion, Last Gospel are (as you will stand and often join in at those points in the Sung Mass), then you can use them as sign posts and start to follow the Missal and work out where the Priest is at other times around those parts (eg. Introit, Collect, Epistle, Gradual, Offetory, Canon, etc). Once you start to memorise the Ordinary of the Mass which are repeated unchanged each time, and then understand the basic structure of the Mass in relation to them, then you can do less flicking back and forward in the Missal and concentrate on the Propers for that day. Personally I don‚Äôt usually check the Epistle or Gospel because our priest will read them again in the vernacular prior to his homily.\n\nFor me, getting to know the Mass this way was easiest. After that. Low Mass made more sense once I understood the structure, even though the kneeling, sitting and standing change and much is inaudible.  Getting a missal or guide which notes when to sit, kneel and stand during High and Low Mass is also useful in helping you find where you are in the Mass.\n\nThis is assuming you want to follow along with the Mass. I prefer to do so, and as someone else said - Pope St Pius X also recommended this way.  However it‚Äôs not absolutely necessary. You can pray privately or say the rosary. The Mass is still effective in doing its work and obtaining graces for you. Unlike the Novus Ordo which is very much a crowd participation event, the TLM is done through the priest acting on your behalf and simply praying reverently and earnestly at the foot of the cross is enough."

He stood firm against error and compromise with courage and clarity, defending the faith when so many were willing to bend. Looking back, it may seem that the battle against these dangers was lost, but in his time his efforts were monumental and inspiring. It is sickening to see that they have placed him in the Vatican, right at the front, in the midst of all the chaos. He is turning in his tomb. Yet we remember him, we honor him, and we give thanks for his tireless work, including his most famous encyclical Pascendi Dominici Gregis, which remains a powerful shield against error. If you go to Mass this Sunday, ask him to pray for you, ask for his intercession. Yesterday there was a special Mass in my SSPX chapel for him, and it was truly magical, a moment that reminded me of the hero he was and still is. Pray for us, St. Pius X.",

It gives rise to no jealousies, it does not favor any one nation, but presents itself with equal impartiality to all and is equally acceptable to all.\"\n\nSo, while Our Lord Jesus Christ used and sanctified the four languages of Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, and Latin, the Holy Spirit led the Church to choose Latin as the universal sacred tongue of Rome for unity and clarity."

Let's just say that the many priests who happily took to the NO were ordained in the old rite. \n\nMany people had such a lukewarm experience of Catholicism. You'd be lucky if you got a sung mass outside of a cathedral or significant church. Most places had a low mass with 4 hymns, the priest would garble through the mass (given that most of it wasn't audible, he could do this). Sermons would be either non-existent, parish notifications/requests for donations or long rambling diatribes about bliz-blaz and him-ham to a largely indifferent congregation who would just be reciting their rosaries. In short, the Tridentine Mass was a pearl thrown before swine. I think the situation we find ourselves in now, with respect to the Old Rite, is very much a better place. Better that it be insulated against people who say it with no care, or those who treat it irreverently. \n\n* Regarding the use of Latin - \n\nthis isn't the gripe of many traditional Catholics. Our main issue isn't the use of a particular language, but how the new mass was a stark departure from what went before. Certainly where I live, those of us who are traditionalists who don't have the confidence to go to the SSPX, often end up attending the Ordinariate Use, which is the Tridentine Mass translated into English. It isn't so much about the language but the intent. Pray in Latin, pray in Greek, pray in Aramaic, pray in English. It's about the substance and intent. A heartfelt prayer in the proper form in the vernacular is much more important to Our Lord than many hundreds of mumbled, half understood Latin prayers.\nThis being said, Latin binds us together as **Roman** Catholics. It is fitting that as Roman Catholics, we should use the shared liturgy and culture of our faith. Just as Greek Catholics use Greek! It brings us together. In the past, it meant that people from diverse origins could all worship together and all hold an equal understanding of the faith. A point to remember is that Greek was the language of the Roman Empire. Latin was the language of Rome.\n\n* On fidelity to Rome\n\nWe must hold to this position. Our alternative is to embrace Protestantism - which we can't do. We hold our fidelity to the Modern church out of compassion. Like a family member who is going through a rough phase and doing things we don't approve of. We don't abandon them, we walk with them, giving an example of what they should do, but also being a helping hand up when they eventually realise the gravity of what they are doing/have done. We are Roman Catholics."

Of course, the liturgy was initially constructed with the listeners' understanding in mind, beyond the worship of God. However, once the liturgy is crystallized in a certain form, with specific prayers and rites, I believe it is very difficult to make substantial changes to it, including the liturgical language used. The main point is not so much the listener's understanding as the worship offered to God through the liturgy, maintaining it as it was received.\n\nAnother, related consideration is that, even if the liturgy is composed in what was initially a vernacular language, it gradually de-vulgarizes and becomes less comprehensible to speakers over time. This is notable for Latin, as it has become a dead language, but it also occurs to some extent with Eastern languages. Their ancient forms are not identical to modern forms, although they retain some intelligibility, to a greater or lesser degree.\n\nThis is my general impression of the history of the liturgy."

There are good reasons to use Latin in the liturgy but actually the language of mass is a minor issue. At the moment, traditional Catholics have to cling to Latin because 1) there are no approved translations of the traditional mass in vernacular languages and 2) since Vatican II the use of the vernacular has been abused to alter the sense of the text of the mass in order to obscure or eliminate the Catholic doctrine of the mass as dogmatized at Trent.\n\n3. To break communion with the bishop of ¬†Rome is to leave the one Church that Christ founded. There is one Church, one Faith, one Baptism and not two or three or more Churches.

I recently took a job that is in cubicle land so there is quite a bit of chatter throughout the day with people talking to their customers. Myself and a coworker work on analytical type work that requires concentration so the chatter can be quite distracting. But there are two people who are very very loud and their voices travel across the whole floor. One in particular spends their day telling everyone about their personal life so it gets frustrating. I have told him in the past that he is very loud but that fell on deaf ears. Yesterday most of them went to a meeting for over an hour and the silence was deafening. My coworker and I were commenting on how lovely it was and how much easier it was to focus and get work done. Then we specifically spoke about the one individual and how neither of us want to hear about his personal life and that maybe he needs to be given more work to do. So that's how the conversation went and now I'm wondering if that was considered gossiping about the fellow and what type of sin that might be. I plan to ask my priest, but sometimes it's hard to get a hold of one of them right away. Any and all thoughts/comments are welcomed. ",

The SSPX merely refuses to settle for deficiencies in the Latin Rite, and doesn't accept the line that the NO and the VO/TLM \"are the same rite.\" It has absolutely nothing to do with the parishioners.

That authority simply ends where the errors begin, and *only* where these errors are espoused. The position of the SSPX is that these Popes are still the Pope, which is why we pray for the Pope during the Mass. Presumably these Popes performed these miracles because God gave them the grace to do so. Much as he gave St. Peter the power to walk on water and heal countless sick people, even though Peter also denied Christ several times and was a notable Judaizer, which is an early heresy for which he was rebuked by St. Paul. God gives us graces according to our station, but nobody has the authority to be mistaken - not even the first Pope. But God's grace is not all or nothing, and he works with imperfect people, even imperfect Popes.\n\n\nIncidentally, on a related note, this is also the reason that we see Eucharistic miracles in hosts consecrated in the Novus Ordo. It's because it really is the Body of Christ. But the SSPX makes no claims to the contrary.\n\n\nPersonally I think it's pretty clear that most people that criticize the SSPX are criticizing an accidental strawman.\n\n\nTo your second question, I discovered the SSPX church when it sent a mission to my rural and mostly Protestant area, and showed me that there are still Catholic Priests out there who did not succumb to the insufferably boomer outcomes of the cultural revolution - Priests who traveled literal hours every week at great personal expense for the care of souls. Long story short, were it not for the SSPX, I would not be Catholic. I truly believe this organization deserves credit for growing the flock at a time when the NO church is frankly collapsing in the West, and they are doing it by being genuine.

The Judica Mei (Psalm 42) and prayers at the foot of the alter, some of the offetories and the last gospel among other things that I‚Äôm probably not remembering were stripped. The priest also went from facing God to having his back to Him. It‚Äôs attempt to get the laity more involved with noble in theory caused confusion on how it was to be interpreted and also got rid of the sacred silence and strict rubrics that organically developed in the Latin Rite for centuries. It‚Äôs not a development of liturgy, it‚Äôs a rupture and a completely new rite. Pope Benedict XVI acknowledged it was a new rite. Sacrosanctum Concilium needs to be repealed. And yes, both SSPX and the Diocesan TLMs  use the 1962 missal. There may be a few minute differences but they will fundamentally will be the same. If it is all that is available to you then yes. Please go, don‚Äôt go out of your way. The mass of the ages is the same everywhere. The rubrics are always the same.\n\nEdit: SSPX admits that though the NO is valid it opens the faithful up to heresy because of the reasons I mentioned above."

You can attend any Latin Mass, whether it's diocesan, FSSP, ICKSP, Institute of Good Shepherd, Oratorian, or any other. The only advice the SSPX gives you is to not attend the Novus Ordo because it is damaging to the faith.\n\nMany people (including me) who go to an SSPX chapel also go to other Latin Masses if they are nearby. Sometimes, my SSPX chapel doesn't have early Mass on weekdays, so I go to some other Latin Mass parish before school. For the Assumption of Mary, my SSPX chapel didn't have a High Mass, only a Low Mass. I went to the (larger) FSSP church where they had a Solemn High Mass. After Mass, we had a parish dinner and I recognized at least 30-40 people from the SSPX chapel.\n\nIn most of the world, there is no option. Many places (like in Italy) don't have a lot of SSPX parishes, but have a lot of FSSP and ICKSP churches. Go to any Latin Mass available to you."

Most trads are worried that the watered-down vibe & loose liturgical rules could mess with our faith (or our kids‚Äô faith), so they‚Äôd rather skip than end up spiritually confused, frustrated, or scandalized. This is also the SSPX's position.\n\nChurch says, unless you‚Äôre sick, caring for someone, or traveling without options‚Äîyou gotta go to Mass on Sunday. It's a big deal. Some trads will say: ‚ÄúIf the only option is an irreverent, possibly sketchy NO that drives me nuts or risks my soul, better to stay home and pray hard.‚Äù Others say, ‚ÄúSuck it up, go, just don‚Äôt receive Communion if you‚Äôre really uncomfortable.‚Äù\n\n*What if there‚Äôs ICKSP or FSSP, but no SSPX?*\n\nOh, that‚Äôs the jackpot (for me personally)! They do old-school Latin Mass, the whole reverence package. If you got those in town, you win‚Äîno controversy, no drama. Fulfills your obligation and gives you the spiritual experience you want.\n\nMy opinion : if there's ANY valid Catholic Mass (NO, TLM, Byzantine, whatever)‚Äîgo. Only skip if you absolutely can‚Äôt, and ideally, only if your confessor/priest says it‚Äôs OK in super rare cases.\nICKSP, SSPX, and FSSP: Full-on trad, fully legit, absolutely go if you can.\nDon‚Äôt let pride or ideology make you cut yourself off from the sacraments. Jesus is bigger than liturgical drama.\n\nHonestly, in the end: Go to Mass. If you can pick, pick the most reverent one. If you hate your local Mass, get creative, travel, or find the least painful option. But don‚Äôt ghost God on Sunday‚ÄîHe‚Äôs waiting to see you!"

And also, not sure if it's catechism or canon law, but you are dispensed from going to Mass if that could harm your faith, so that applies if you live in an area with only the New Mass.\n\n\nMeanwhile, on the second topic, yes I'd go to a non-SSPX Latin Mass but I know there might be people here who might not agree with me, since FSSP was created as a Vatican II-aprooved Latin Mass group.

Faith has been relativized, the Holy Eucharist is treated as a banquet, the Holy Mass through this profane liturgy is diminished as a liturgy performed for thanksgiving. It is the result of disobedience between God and man, totally ignoring the Sacred Tradition and disrespecting the lex orandi and lex credendi that make up the Holy Mother Church. Its liturgical structure goes completely against what the Church has always said. \n\nIn the third canon of the twentieth and second session of the Council of Trent it says the following: \nCanon III ‚Äì If anyone says that the sacrifice of the Mass is only a sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; or that it is a mere commemoration of the finished sacrifice on the cross, but not a propitiatory sacrifice; or that it benefits only the one who receives it; and that it should not be offered by the living and the dead for sins, pains, satisfactions and other needs; be anathema.\n(Council of Trent, July 15th MDLXII ‚Äî XXI Session, Canon III)\n\n It is a total disrespect for the Most Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and the most important dogma declared by the Holy Church, the Holy Mass of Always.\nIn the year 1570, Saint Pius V through his bull Quo Primum Tempore declared the Holy Mass of Always as incorruptible and irreplaceable, as he says according to sections 6, 11 and 14 of the same. Saint Pius V also in Quo Primum Tempore dogmatically proclaimed that this Mass can be celebrated without restrictions or prohibitions, as he says in session no. 7.\n\nPope Paul VI himself stated the disrespect for this dogma in his letter Missale Romanum written by him at the Second Vatican Council.\n\nThis is what Paul VI said: \"The Roman Missal which, in accordance with the decree of the Tridentine Council, was promulgated in 1570 by our predecessor Saint Pius V, is counted among the many and admirable fruits that that Holy Synod spread throughout the Church of Christ. In fact, for four centuries, the priests of the Latin rite had it as a norm for the celebration of the Eucharistic sacrifice, and the holy heralds of the Gospel introduced it to almost the entire earth. In it also many Saints copiously nourished their piety towards God, drawing it both from readings of Holy Scripture and from their prayers, the main part of which was organized by Saint Gregory the Great.\nBut, since the desire to promote the sacred liturgy began to grow and strengthen among the Christian people - a desire that, according to the words of our venerable predecessor Pius XII, must be considered a favorable sign of Divine Providence towards the people of our time and a salutary passage of the Holy Spirit through his Church - it became evident that the formulas of the Roman Missal should be restored and enriched.\"\n(Pope Paul VI, 1969 ‚Äî Missale Romanum, Second Vatican Council)\n\nA dogma is a truth of faith that cannot be tampered with, much less denied, so do not accept a profane rite such as the Novus Ordo Missae.\nI hope you understand, my dear. Free Deo!"

The Israelites sent him with tribute to Eglon king of Moab.  \n**16** Ehud made himself a double-edged sword, a cubit long, and strapped it under his clothes on his right thigh.  \n**17** He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab, a very fat man.  \n**18** When he had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the men who had carried it.  \n**19** But he himself turned back from the idols near Gilgal and said, ‚ÄòI have a secret message for you, O king.‚Äô The king said, ‚ÄòSilence!‚Äô and all his attendants withdrew from his presence.  \n**20** Ehud went in to him; he was sitting alone in his cool upper room. Ehud said, ‚ÄòI have a message from God for you.‚Äô And the king rose from his seat.  \n**21** Ehud reached with his left hand, drew the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into Eglon‚Äôs belly.  \n**22** The hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for Ehud did not pull the sword out of his belly, and the filth came out.  \n**23** Then Ehud went out onto the porch, shut the doors of the upper room behind him, and locked them.  \n**24** After he had gone, the servants came and found the doors of the upper room locked. They said, ‚ÄòHe must be relieving himself in the cool room.‚Äô  \n**25** They waited until they were embarrassed, but still he did not open the doors of the upper room. So they took the key and opened them; there lay their master dead on the ground.  \n**26** Ehud escaped while they delayed. Passing beyond the idols, he escaped to Seirah.  \n**27** When he arrived, he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites came down from the hills under his leadership.  \n**28** He said to them, ‚ÄòFollow me, for the Lord God has given your enemies the Moabites into your hands.‚Äô They followed him and seized the fords of the Jordan leading to Moab; they did not allow anyone to cross.  \n**29** At that time they struck down about ten thousand Moabites, all vigorous and able-bodied men; not one escaped.  \n**30** So Moab was subdued that day under Israel‚Äôs hand, and the land had peace for eighty years."

There are ways that SSPX is exceptional compared to, say, the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter. However, I can say both from my studies and personal experience that the SSPX encompasses a variety of cultures, opinions, and activities that can't be reduced to an \"SSPX identity\" beyond what people choose to assign to *their* reflections and conclusions imposed on SSPX the way Christians naturally assign movements of the intellect to their Priests. \n\nIf someone asks me \"What does SSPX think about X?\", \"What would SSPX do if Y happened?\", or \"What would the Archbishop think/do about Z?\" then they're calling me to speculate based on *my* imperfect intellect. \n\nIt's also something better answered by someone who's not a laywoman. The Society goes to great lengths to post [articles](https://marcellefebvre.info/en/successful-venture-34575) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLonegYXBrLbS9l74Oxl28eopEN1rT8jPi) accessible even to Catholics who were barely catechized. If there's any broad sweeping statements I could make about the Priests and others, they're eager and adept at conveying the Sacred Tradition to people from many different contexts and levels of involvement and that (contrary to certain opinions) we're generally accommodating and inclusive. We're not any \"more\" or \"less\" Christian, someone is either a Christian or they're not. \n\nWe're sinners and walkers with God. \n\nRelated, many of us are heavily involved \"outside the Society\" which I put in quotations because the Society is inside the same Church as every other Roman Catholic Christian. We're not huddled in our corner of Christendom conspiring against the Novus Ordo, we're nurturing, protecting, and sharing the Tradition that is the custody of the Universal Church as a whole. This is even something I see TradCaths get cloudy on because they think in terms of being part of a \"clique\" instead of Christ's community. Glory has its beginning and end in the Mystical Body of Christ with the overarching goal being fellowship in the Kingdom of Heaven. \n\nThat being said, if you'd like to ask a married laywoman questions, feel free to do so in the comments.",

According to them, women shouldn't work or go to university\n2. According to them, women shouldn't wear trousers\n3. According to them, women should be either wives or nuns\n\nRegarding No. 1:\n\nHow is a family with children supposed to survive with only one working partner? A lot of people even need to work 2 or more jobs. This seems highly unrealistic to me.\n\nRegarding university: I know many women who are incredibly intelligent and capable - more capable than most men I know. They studied law, philosophy, different sciences and so on. Why would God create them like that, as logical thinkers with high intelligence, if He intended them to clean a house all day?\n\nRegarding No. 2:\n\nI often hear this when the topic is modesty. They view it as more traditional for a man to wear suits and a woman to wear dresses, but usually this seems to be more about preserving 50s-60s fashion than actually being modest. They pick a decade that's associated with traditional, romantic values and decide that you have to act like the people back then to be truly modest and Christian. Why don't we wear medieval clothing? Or what Romans wore around year zero? I don't see why women shouldn't wear trousers like wide suit pants, which are imo modest without cosplaying the sixties. (Nothing wrong with doing so, but forcing it is weird).\n  \nRegarding No. 3:\n\nWhy can't a woman be a single, working and pursuing career? I'm genuinely curious here. Is it for both genders wrong to choose a rather individualistic lifestyle by being a \"secular single\"? Are you supposed to either focus on God and choose a spiritual path or focus on marriage, no matter if you're male or female?\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nMany of these things seem to me like they‚Äôre rather about preserving a romantic view on the 50s and 60s, even though many weren‚Äôt able to live such a life style back then, no matter if it‚Äôs about clothing, work or family. \n\nI can imagine that this is kinda because of the Vatican II reforms being implemented in the 60s, so you view the decade before that as ideal, but isn‚Äôt that rather how you, individually, live out tradition and not something you have to do as Catholics? \n\nA lot of the things many of you view as a part of traditionalism seem to be rather modern, capitalist ideals. For hundreds of years it was normal for AVERAGE women (by that, I mean those who weren‚Äôt rich) to work in their family businesses or be employed before marriage. \n\nI completely understand that you view changes, such as liturgical reforms critically, but truly can‚Äôt understand the romanticised conservatism. \n\nI'm curious to hear what you think and open to change my opinion!",

The *real* thinking isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwomen = no brain, stay in kitchen,‚Äù it‚Äôs more like ‚ÄúGod set up men and women differently, and the family is the central thing society rests on.‚Äù Everything else in trad thought kind of flows from that.  \n\n**On women working / going to uni:**  \nNo one‚Äôs saying women can‚Äôt ever have a job or go to college ‚Äî it‚Äôs about priorities. Ideally, you set up life so that when kids come, mom can be home with them. That‚Äôs not because she‚Äôs ‚Äúless‚Äù than her husband ‚Äî it‚Äôs because kids actually *need* both parents, and moms usually have a special touch in early formation. But yes, in the real world? Rent, groceries, inflation ‚Äî sometimes a wife works, and that‚Äôs fine if it‚Äôs necessary. It‚Äôs more ‚Äúthis is the ideal‚Äù than ‚Äúor else you‚Äôre sinning.‚Äù  \n\n**On pants vs skirts:**  \nThe anti-pants thing comes from a mix of modesty concerns and the idea that men and women should dress distinctly. Deuteronomy 22:5 - not wearing clothes of the opposite sex, but also ‚Äî historically, pants were a man thing, skirts/dresses a woman thing. That‚Äôs just the visual line in the sand. And yes, the 50s aesthetic gets romanticized, but it‚Äôs not *about* the 50s. It‚Äôs about keeping clothing modest, feminine, and respectful. If you rock a long, loose, modest pair of pants, you‚Äôre probably not scandalizing anyone, but some trads still just prefer the skirt standard as a rule.  \n\n**On ‚Äúwife or nun‚Äù:**  \nIn the Catholic worldview, your life is meant to be a gift ‚Äî either to your spouse/kids in marriage or to God directly in religious life. The ‚Äúcareer-focused single person‚Äù thing is culturally normal now but doesn‚Äôt have a theological foundation. Not saying you can‚Äôt be single for a long time ‚Äî some people never meet the right person or discern religious life ‚Äî but in trad thinking, permanent ‚Äúme first, no commitments‚Äù isn‚Äôt the goal.  \n\n**On the nostalgia for the past:**  \nIt‚Äôs not about thinking the 50s were perfect. Those decades just happened to still have a culture that lined up more with Catholic social teaching ‚Äî intact families, faith in the public square, local communities that actually functioned. SSPX people look at that and say, ‚ÄúSee, that‚Äôs closer to what works‚Äù compared to what we‚Äôve got now.  \n\nIt‚Äôs not ‚Äúwomen bad, men king‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs ‚Äúmen and women both have a mission, and society works better when those roles complement each other like they‚Äôre designed to.‚Äù Everything else, like skirts or staying home, is an application of that principle."

It seems to me that there are certain people who warp the traditions and rules of the Faith into something it‚Äôs not. Unfortunately this can happen with any worldview or religion, where people use misinterpreted facets of it and use it as an excuse to behave poorly. To my understanding of the Catholic faith, it‚Äôs about balance, which can be more difficult to see clearly in the modern world. For example, there is nothing in our Faith that says it is sinful to live a single life. However, there are more graces that can be obtained through the sacraments of Marriage and Holy orders (priesthood), and the idea is that either of these vocations create a defined path to guide us to the ultimate goal of Heaven. The Church does not teach that it is sinful for women to work or go to school, but oftentimes it is seen as preferable for women to focus on giving all of her energy to raising children while in the season of motherhood. Contrary to how extreme ‚Äútrads‚Äù, and those of the opposite side of the spectrum think of it, putting our all into our children should use our full intellect, rather than neglect it."

        "body": "Lets set tradition aside for a moment and talk about hormones. Men and women are different. We have different hormones that change our cognition.\n\n\"Estrogen significantly influences cognition, generally enhancing functions like memory and executive processing by acting on brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. It particularly supports verbal memory and can improve learning and memory performance. Higher lifetime estrogen exposure is linked to lower risk of cognitive decline, with benefits in memory, reasoning, and neurogenesis. However, in older postmenopausal women, effects may be neutral or absent, especially with short-term hormone therapy or combined progestogens, and declining levels during menopause can impair sleep, mood, and cognitive performance.\n\nYes, estrogen impacts nervousness (anxiety). Stable or higher levels, particularly estradiol, reduce anxiety-like behaviors and subjective anxiety by modulating stress responses and enhancing brain inhibition. Low estrogen increases vulnerability to anxiety, mood disorders, and conditions like PTSD, while fluctuations (e.g., during menstrual cycles or stress) can heighten nervousness, depression, and emotional dysregulation. Hormone replacement therapy may alleviate anxiety in some cases, though results vary.\n\nEstrogen also affects attention, improving selective attention and reducing impairments in attention-related tasks, especially under stress or cognitive challenges, leading to better focus and cognitive speed.\" ‚ÄìGrok\n\n\"Estrogen levels decrease sharply after childbirth. During pregnancy, estrogen (especially estradiol) rises significantly to support fetal development and other changes. After delivery, particularly after the placenta is expelled (a major estrogen source), levels drop rapidly within hours to days, returning to pre-pregnancy or near-menopausal levels. This can contribute to mood changes, cognitive shifts, and increased anxiety. Breastfeeding may keep estrogen suppressed longer due to elevated prolactin, which inhibits ovarian estrogen production.\" ‚ÄìGrok\n\nBefore childbirth estrogen makes women feminine. After childbirth we see a drop in estrogen that makes a mother more nervous and have a diffuse attention. This is great for taking care of a young child and protecting them from danger.\n\nEven newborns have different neurochemical responses to mothers and fathers. How a child relates to each parent is special and unique. A father cannot occupy the role of a mother and a mother cannot occupy the role of a father.\n\nIf a child does not get to have a relationship with their mother and father they are losing something that they were meant to have. If the parents ‚Äìparticulairly the mother‚Äì aren't the primary caregiver for a child until roughly the age of four or five that child is losing something that they were meant to have.\n\nA mother and father have a unique responsibility towards children and the relationship that parents have with their children means that they care significantly more than any other caregiver about fulfilling the needs that a child has. You also learn the cues or language that each child has, which makes you more responsive. The habits and patterns that you learn also let you address problems before they fully manifest. This intimacy of parenthood can't be replaced by daycare.\n\nGiven Church teaching on contraceptives and what science and reason tell us about a mothers role in childcare there isn't a lot of room for a career and an education is a significant financial burden.\n\nIf a woman wants to be educated it may be a financial obstacle to motherhood. If a mother wants to have a career it is probably an injustice to her children.\n\nIt is a tough choice for some people. It is an easier choice when mothers are shown respect and dignity for the incredibly important role that they fulfill in raising well adjusted and flourishing children.\n\nSo what about work and pants?\n\nPeople need purpose. If a woman doesn't have children she needs to be occupied with a purpose and a job can provide that. Education can fill that purpose too. Though good judgement should be excercised, because some jobs have a lot of interaction with vulgar and degrading people. Higher education can be a particularly terrible environment both in terms of culture and ideology.\n\nPants can be modest. However, dresses are beautiful and feminine. As Catholics we should desire to present ourselves well as children of God. Catholic men and women should both be distinguished in our behavior and by extension our clothing."

If they wait until marriage to start having children they should be reasonably well established before their expenses increase.

Very grave! A total perversion!

It comes from heresy and results in heresy, even if all its acts are not formally heretical. It is thus impossible for any faithful Catholic who is aware of these things to adopt this reform, or to submit to it in any way at all.¬†To ensure our salvation, the only attitude of fidelity to the Church and to Catholic doctrine, is a categorical refusal to accept the reform. ... That is why we hold fast to all that has been believed and practiced in the faith, morals, liturgy, teaching of the catechism, formation of the priest and institution of the Church, by the Church of all time;¬†to all these things as codified in those books which saw day before the Modernist influence of the Council.‚Äù (Declaration¬†of Faith, November 21, 1974)\n\n‚ÄúWe can think that there is Rome and Rome: [on one hand,] there is the Rome which is eternal in Her Faith, Her Dogmas, Her concept of the Sacrifice of the Mass; [on the other hand,]¬†there is the temporal Rome which is influenced by the ideas of the modern world, an influence which the Council itself did not escape.‚Äù (October 13, 1974)\n\n‚ÄúThe Church, in the course of the 1960's, thus¬†during the Council, acquired values that have come from outside the Church, from the liberal culture -¬†due secoli¬†- from two centuries of liberal culture. It is clear:¬†these are the \"rights\" of man, it is religious freedom, it is ecumenism. It is Satanic.‚Äù (Conference, December 13, 1984)\n\n\"Without rejecting this Council wholesale,¬†I think that it is the greatest disaster of this century and of all the past centuries, since the founding of the Church.\" The Angelus¬†A Matter of Principle\n‚ÄúI never‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt accept the Council!

It is a deep mystery‚Ä¶If I take the position of the Council, I am betraying my Mother Church.‚Äù (Archbishop Lefebvre, conference, 1976)\n\nWe [Bishop de Castro Mayer and the Archbishop] fought together to prevent¬†the errors of Liberalism, which are a cancer in the doctrine of the Church, spreading themselves in the texts of the Council. ... Unfortunately, this Liberal principle has been adopted by Vatican II. ...¬†If one does not want to believe that these texts are Liberal, one has just to see the consequences: ecumenism (all religion on an equal footing), and the laicization of the states.¬†Ordination Sermon 1988\nAnd, so I said to him [Cardinal Ratzinger], \"What is the source of these bad fruits? For me,¬†it is the Council¬†of¬†aggiornamento; that signifies the Council of the changes. What changes?¬†Changes in the sacraments, changes in catechisms, changes in the Bible, so that we are no longer Catholics [but] are like Protestants. ... And he said, \"No! No, no, no, that does not come from the Council; it comes from bad interpretations of the Council; it comes from abuses of the reforms.\" I said, \"That is not true.¬†That comes from the new orientation of the Church in the Council, especially by ecumenism.\"¬†Changes in the Sacraments...We are like Protestants 1985\n‚ÄúIt is stupefying to read in the Documentation Catholique that the Lutheran-Catholic Commission of the Secretariat for Christian Unity, and thus an official Roman commission, said in effect that¬†numerous points in the Council were drawn from the teachings of Luther‚Ä¶‚Äù (Conference in Germany, October 29, 1984)\n\nThe Church has always dreaded novelties, even in her vocabulary and that is why she has held on so strongly to the Latin language in the principal form of Tradition, viz. the Roman Church.¬†For it is by a tendency to novelty that heresies, schisms, and errors have come about.¬†This spirit of novelty, mutation, and change has succeeded in entering into the Church. It necessarily tends to destroy Tradition.¬†The Second Vatican Council, which wished to be the Council of \"up-dating,\" opened the door to this spirit of change and novelty.¬†(Principles and Directives -¬†1982 General Chapter)\n\n‚ÄúThe Council should have been the occasion of the reaffirmation of the Truth of the Church and the necessity of the social reign of Jesus and Mary against the errors of Protestantism and Teilhardian naturalism and against socialism and communism. Ordinary Protestants would have been converted¬†en masse. They were disposed to it and their debacle was profound on the eve of the Council.¬†But the Modernists, traitors to the Church, used the Council to favor their compromise with all the modern errors, profiting from a weak pope and a pope disposed to radical changes.¬†All of the commentators on the Council recognize the triumph of the liberals who did not hide their satisfaction and who neutralized or drove from the Roman Curia all of the conservatives and who took the reins of government, centralizing power in the Secretariat of State in order to be certain of managing the ecumenical revolution so much desired by the enemies of the Church. The work was quickly carried out in all fields.¬†Destruction also followed quickly. In this pastoral Council the spirit of error and lies was able to work at its ease, placing time-bombs everywhere which, in due course, would destroy the institutions.¬†(Principles and Directives -¬†1982 General Chapter)"

The replies last time were mixed. Some were thoughtful. Some dismissive. But what stood out most was the silence. Not only here, but also more broadly. And that silence is troubling, considering what is at stake.\n\nThis new video from the same channel goes deeper. It is the first in a new series titled For the Man in the Pew, and the episode is called He Will Not Kneel to Error. It is not an attack. It begins with a prayer. It speaks calmly and seriously. And it reflects the position I believe many of us are in. Grateful for what we received through Tradition. But deeply concerned about what is happening now.\n\nI am not trying to stir controversy. I am sincerely asking: If Archbishop Lefebvre always demanded conditional ordination to protect the faithful from doubt, then why would that principle no longer apply?

The response of Rome would simply be \"John XXIII issued this Missal, so it's the only one that you can use.\" And there is, as you said, nothing that compromises the faith in the 62 Missal. \n\nI personally use a 1960 Missal which is nearly the same except the feasts are ranked slightly differently and there's no St Joseph in the canon.\n\nHe went on to say, it's one thing at a time. \n\nAnd to be fair, the Pacellian reforms weren't all bad. The permission to offer mass in the evenings was a wonderful addition and Pius X almost certainly would have accepted this. As was the relaxing of the Eucharistic fast. The ranking of feasts also needed reform - as it has been observed - by the early 20th century, green vestments were almost never seen. This was not good as the real core of the faith is in the Sunday masses. \n\nSo I think in time, the society will probably go back to the 1954 Missal but definitely not in the near future. \n\nThere are some communities that are now using the pre-55 Missal - some that are regular (FSSP/ICKSP and some Oratorians) and some that are irregular (the Benedictines at Brignoles - where my friend from university is a priest)."

Are we currently in, and can we ever juridically be, in a position to assert this as a matter of fact even if our intuition tells us it is true.\n\n\nPreferring the old rite doesn't really make a difference. One could even personally prefer the new rite and still admit as a matter of fact that, that despite its validity, the NO is still lacking the fundamental aspects of a licit Mass and therefore it is dangerous.\n\n\nMe, I see 1 as a matter of fact which can be demonstrated both logically and historically, with evidence and using reason. However it was critical that Abp. Lefebvre had the position he had, and that we continue to have Bishops, if a good case for 2 being affirmative is still to be made. We aren't just deciding ourselves to be disobedient, we are concurring with those who were/are authoritatively in teaching positions inside the Church, who disagree with others in the same visible institution. The question is not settled, which is why it is an irregular but not severed connection to the larger Church.\n\n\nWhat constitutes a Catholic is the same for both - generally, adherence to the doctrines and dogmas promulgated authoritatively by the visible Church founded by Jesus Christ - but the difference lies in what those doctrines and dogmas are, and whether they were authoritatively promulgated. Modernism cannot ever be promulgated by anyone in any circumstance since it is an error.\n\n\nThe difference between a reluctant NO attendee trad and a patron of the SSPX is usually in how they would answer 2."

That bearing out is happening right now.\n\n\nTo answer your second question, the SSPX position as I understand it (and I agree with it) is that teaching a heresy by itself is not necessarily \"falling into error\" in the formal or irredeemable sense. Casual and non-infallible allusions by several Popes made to a purely pastoral council that was highly political in hindsight are regrettable, confusing, and dangerous, but it isn't like the determination that there were demonstrable errors at VII disproves the papacy.

        "body": "Correct. Nicaea convened by all accounts to settle fundamental matters of Faith, and then it did so. The products of the council are foundational to the Catholic Faith. Vatican II, in contrast, was convened explicitly as a pastoral council, in order to find a way to repackage the Faith in a way more conducive to \"Modern man\" (whatever that is), but not to fundamentally change anything in matters of Faith or morals. Both John XXIII and Paul VI said that exact same thing - it is merely a question of the Church's strategy in modernity, not in its substance. Now the SSPX maintains while this may have been the original intention, that ultimately there were demonstrable ideological changes that have had an obvious effect on the life and mind of the Church as an institution. These changes were due to the Council being hijacked by an extremely prepared and well-coordinated ideological contingency devoted, sadly, to the Modernism that Pius X warned about explicitly throughout his entire Papacy. But, because the council was unambiguously non-dogmatic, questioning its implementation and promulgation is not questioning Papal authority, nor is it questioning the Faith. We can acknowledge that Pope Paul VI earnestly desired to reform the Church for his day, that as Pope he certainly ordered people to implement the reform, that the reform is imperfect and it itself needs clarification on all doctrinal points which were ambiguous on purpose (with some clarification essentially refuting certain statements on the most egregiously weaponized ambiguities), and we can still submit to the Pope. The Pope is allowed to be wrong when there is no expectation of infallibility, even when he, and a majority of the Church under him, insists that he is right. \n\nThis is the position of the SSPX. I adopted it because it seems reasonable to me. I think we can eat our cake and have it too on this one. When you love someone then you correct them fraternally, and we ought to love each and every one of our Holy Fathers, and desire sincerely that Christ's will be done as effectively as possible in the visible institution of the Church. A reform that does a service for one moment in time may be doing it a disservice in the next moment.\n\nAs an American, I look at it like our border laws. The laws never changed between administrations, but we had one administration that upheld them, and another one that claimed it upheld them, but from a visible standpoint it was clear that the change in strategy resulted in the laws not achieving their stated goals. Regardless of how one feels about the laws, the laws themselves did not change substantively; only the political will to implement them in a certain way changed. I would like to believe that it was ignorance and not malice that resulted in the change in tactics by those with the authority to uphold the law. But either way, the laws don't need to change to fix the problem, we just need strong leaders to do what we already said we were going to do on paper. So too with the crisis in the Church, and with Her laws. The Faith itself is the remedy to problems that stem primarily from strategic ambiguity."

I recommend reading what the SSPX has to say about it in their own materials, if you want to know their true position, since their position is usually strawmanned by very uninformed but perhaps well-meaning people. It is not as harsh as many are led to believe, and many of their questions are both theologically tenable as well as unsettled juridically.\n\n\nIt's not an easy question, and as Catholics, we shouldn't take even the possibility of anything that could even potentially be misconstrued as disobedience lightly. It was something I had to look at very carefully myself. It is a fact that the SSPX is superficially disobedient in certain matters. The questions that need answered are, what is real obedience, what are the limits of authority, and in what way is authority rightly exercised; and these questions need to be answered in the context of the indefectible teaching of the one, holy, Catholic, and apostolic Church.\n\n\nI don't believe in following any organization blindly, so here's another resource I found helpful which makes the case from the other side:\n\n\nhttps://www.wordonfire.org/vatican-ii-faq/#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cpastoral%E2%80%9D%20council?-,No.,merely%20dealing%20with%20pastoral%20matters.\n\n\nThis is a refutation of the SSPX claims done by Word on Fire (Bishop Barron's publication). WoF is usually really good, and I listen to Bp. Barron speak regularly. If anyone can make an honest effort to oppose the SSPX, I believe it would be them. But the logic holes in this argument further convinced me that the SSPX could be on to something. For example, I don't consider a ban on the Mass said by the Church for thousands of years, the placement of radically ideological appointments who produced unprecedented and unjust outcomes (I am cancelling your Masses for your own good, I promise!) and the ensuing chaos in the Faith (expressed in apostasy rates, poor catechesis, and an explosion of liturgical nonsense) as legitimate acts of an¬†\"obviously authentic\" (but not infallible) magisterium. The SSPX just says these things actually look very much like mistakes when judged in the light of Tradition, and that owning up to them and undoing them, rather than doubling down on them, is the only way to restore the broader Institution. I also don't understand the claim that pastoral material not declared infallible is still \"under the protection of the Holy Spirit.\" The Holy Spirit does not will, nor protect, error. It sounds like they are ginning up technical infallibility where it is juridically inappropriate to do so. SSPX gets criticized for Ultramontanism (hyper-Papalism) because of their reliance on encyclicals from anti-Modernist Popes. But Modernists do the same thing with their preferred Popes and writings. This is essentially why this matter is juridically unsettled, since there are opposing claims produced by the same visible institution which are unresolved.\n\n\nIt is a bit like what CS Lewis said in Mere Christianity: if it can be demonstrated that we are headed in the wrong direction, the most progressive person is the one who starts going backward first. And we avoid false antiquarianism because we are only returning to the precise moment before the trouble effectively starts - a Missal approved and promulgated by the very same Pope that convened VII - and we lose no dogma or doctrine in the process, aside from fallible materials produced in VII that Modernists and Boomers have been pretending is infallible for decades now.\n\n\nAnyways, SSPX still accepts 95% of VII, mostly because, by design (see Bugnini), the council was designed to be ambiguous. So material lacking in substance is easy to accept because it doesn't really say anything. It is only certain statements regarding religious liberty, ecumenism, and collegiality that they take issue with. These statements, far from a \"reinterpretation\" of doctrine, directly and demonstrably contradict previous teachings of the indefectible magisterium of times past. These issues, when researched, become clearly connected with the structural issues of today's visible institution of the Church, which began resulting at the very same time - not as a coincidence, but as a direct effect of these novel teachings, the SSPX argues.\n\n\nGod bless you as you ask the tough questions! Even if you ultimately disagree, please remember that the SSPX loves the Church, we love Novis Ordo goers, and in large part we hope sincerely for a proper reunion for the sake of the world's souls. We are just working out our salvation with fear and trembling in the meantime at the Mass of the Ages.\n\n\nEDIT: Let me know if you have any questions as I would be happy to answer them"

This assistance is to be given principally:\n\n>¬†\\[...\\]\n\n>2¬† by personal preparation for entering marriage, **so that the spouses are disposed to the holiness and the obligations of their new state**\n\n=> The priest does not speak as a marriage counselor, psychologist, financial advisor, lawyer,... but marriage preparation course is part of the Church's proclamation, insofar as it prepares for the reception of the **sacrament of marriage** (analogous to the instruction for First Communion and Confirmation)."

You have to come and see some time!\"\nAnd a couple hours later we were texting each other, and he said, \"Hey man! I support your explotation of SSPX. Maybe it is where God is leading you, I cannot know any better.\"\nWe had a good conversation after that.\nA couple of weeks later, we were texting again , and ge brought up the SSPX again( at this point I wish I had my mouth shut when I told him I went to the priory). He reached out the local archdiocese to clarify if a Catholic can attend the SSPX Mass. They gave him a vague answer. He showed me an email...\nOk, I knew they would not tell him anything I knew already before. \nThan we met for a cup of coffee and started talking about the SSPX again. My friend is a devout Catholic, I love and respect this guy, he is knowledgeable, and whatnot. I told him that Archbishop Lefebrve signed 14 out of 16 Vatican II documents. He responded that Lefebrve back out from it pretty fast, JPII( I am sorry, but I cannot call this man a saint) gavr him time to come back and repent, and he also promised Lefebrve two( or four?) bishops in two years...\nThen, of course, we talked about the TLM. I said that this Mass was orgsnically developed. He said it wasn't. He brought up some \"experts\" from YT( to which , of course, he did not provide the links). He also said, \"Apostles did not say the TLM!\"\nHe also swears  by GIRM and keeps blaming the laity for not living out the prescriptions of Vatican II.\nNext day, after the Mass, I told him that we should close that topic because I didn't think we were heading anywhere and we would not find the right answer, abd I just wanted to make my peace with with God, and be faithful to Eternal Church. \nI love and respect what SSPX does and I did not hear anything anti-Catholic and anti-Vatican comkng from their side...\nAnd my friend's overseeing of my religious journey( I am a fresh convert from Orthodox Church) and his \"I know it all, you should do this for your benefit\" vibe( all of these from my perception, not trying to badmouth him here!)\nMake me feel so empty and torn apart. I feel like I have to police my every move, my every word and my every thought with him...\nWhat you guys think?\nSorry for the long post. Hope it makes some sense. \nHave a wonderful one!\nCheers",

Perhaps kissing the Quran was not the right move, but the Pope acted with the intention of peace, and this should suffice on what we ask of a human being. If there is any judgement to be made on this, we would be wise on leaving it to God, who knows all things.\n\nAgain, no matter your personal intuitions, do stop saying that he has committed the unforgivable sin (which is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit)."

John Paul II was very close to this, but only Francis directly said all religions save. \n\nAnd I don't see how the great wars were based on religion. Nazis were secular, Soviets atheists. The first world war also had nothing to do with religion since the catalyst was a terrorist seeking to have his home region annexed by the country of his ethnic group, if anything, both were based on nationalism and race but not religion directly by any means. Catholic French and Catholic English people killed each other for hundreds of years, Sunni Muslims and pagans too between themselves, and the list goes on. \n\nTo further explain, as I previously said, the holy spirit is also a personal being so if you for instance curse him you are committing a blasphemy against the holy spirit, I did not mean that in the sense of \"blasphemy against the spirit of truth by refusing to accept the truth or denying the Catholic religion or miracles or the mercy of God or spirituality\".

In addition, it enjoys special divine assistance, in comparison to other rites, because it was preserved in the Church of Rome, the See of the blessed apostle Peter. A See that has always inviolably preserved the dogma of the faith.\n\n2nd It is argued that the Roman Rite must always be preserved in its integrity, without substantial modifications as occurred in 1969. In other words, a radical reform of a centuries-old rite of the Catholic Church is illegitimate.

        "body": "The oldest rite in the church is probably the Antiochene rite - which is dated to around the 3rd century AD. We find that there are many things in this that are common across the Eastern and Western rites, such as the mass of the catechumens who were dismissed, an offertory, an epiclesis (laying on of hands - Hanc igitur in the Latin rite) and distribution of communion.\n\nThe Roman Rite naturally *evolved* from this, in the same way that the Eastern Rites *evolved* - bits were added that enhanced it and to which suited the cultures it was part of. It was formally codified in this period from the 3rd century through to the 16th, when Pius V finally issued the definitive edition with the Papal Bull - *Quo Primum*. It's worth remembering that prior to this, the Roman Rite was not at all uniform across the west. There were lots of regional variations. Where I am from, we had the use of Sarum, the use of York, the use of Durham and the various monastic and religious rites - but there was a lot of commonality - and the Anaphora (the canon - or \"Eucharistic Prayer\" to use a modern term...) was consistent to all of them.\n\nThe Eastern churches that reconciled with Rome were encouraged to gently conform their liturgy with the Latin forms. But they had a lot of practices that were alien to the Roman Rite, not least, the use of Coptic, Slavonic, Syriac and Greek instead of Latin.\n\nIn the wake of the 2nd Vatican Council, the Eastern Catholic churches were encouraged to change their liturgy too, in the spirit of the Romans. They encouraged more lay participation - prior to this, the Eastern rite was clearly divided into the laity and the clergy, and the use of vernacular language was encouraged away from the use of either Latin or the various liturgical languages of the East.\n\nThe church is not divided into East and West - they can be considered two sides of the same body. Lungs if you will, from which the breath of the faith (the *spiritus* or *œÄŒΩŒµœçŒºŒ±*) comes forth.\n\nThere were many Eastern Catholics who were unhappy - they formed the Society of St Josephat Kuntsevych who are affiliated with the SSPX.\n\nSo in short, yes, short hand is the Mass of All Time to refer to the Tridentine Mass, simply because, it's the most commonly celebrated rite within the traditionalist movement. But there are other traditional liturgies available.\n\nAs a slight aside, I will add that the Eastern Orthodox are not immune to these types of splits. The Old Believers emerged in the Russian Orthodox church in the 17th century, in response to the reforms made by the then Patriarch of Moscow, Nikon. The old believers persist in their practice to this day, despite being anathemised."

They were not happy with Abp Lefebvre's acceptance of the 62 Missal or his tolerance of the second Vatican council. For reference, the position of the SSPX is that the second Vatican council is valid and binding in about 90% of its texts - it's just that the 10% is particularly egregious in how it affects the faith (recommend reading *They Have Uncrowned Him - Abp Lefebvre* for full details).\n\nThe 55 revisions were the first dip in the water for the ultimate revisions of the Mass. Many Catholics at the time were completely unaware and it really empowered Fr Bugnini to be able to push on with his more radical reforms. \n\nBut the fruits of the rebellious nine became clear, as they were soon suckered into open Sedevacantism and left the Society.\n\nI cannot deny their faith and for me, I prefer the pre-55 ceremonials. The hand Missal I use was published in 1960 which is a bit of a weird middle ground between 55 and 62. It has both the pre-55 and post-55 Holy Week and the name of St Joseph is not included in the canon. But, we are called to be obedient to Rome to a point. We cannot accept heresy but as the 62 Missal is generally in conformity with Roman Catholic tradition, it remains acceptable to use.\n\nSo, if I could find a group that was both obedient to the Holy See and also followed the 54 Missal, I'd jump on it, but the SSPX holds a very great position in terms of Roman Catholic tradition.\n\nAnd to add to this, I recently spoke with a fairly senior priest within the society who said that the 54 Missal remained on the table, but was a goal of the Society once they had managed to get the main church to return to more normal Traditions. But we still have a long way to go. Bishop Fellay said it, in a sermon some years ago, that the traditional movement is like a seedling in the early spring. If it grows too fast and too quickly without putting down solid roots, then a frost will come and kill it, so great care must be taken in how we proceed. But Our Lord will triumph in the end!"

They immediately precede the quote above from the same letter: \n\n\"Another mistake, which I deeply regret, is the fact that the extent and limits of the provision of 21 January 2009 were not clearly and adequately explained at the moment of its publication. The excommunication affects individuals, not institutions. An episcopal ordination lacking a pontifical mandate raises the danger of a schism, since it jeopardizes the unity of the College of Bishops with the Pope. Consequently the Church must react by employing her most severe punishment ‚Äì excommunication ‚Äì with the aim of calling those thus punished to repent and to return to unity. Twenty years after the ordinations, this goal has sadly not yet been attained. The remission of the excommunication has the same aim as that of the punishment: namely, to invite the four Bishops once more to return. This gesture was possible once the interested parties had expressed their recognition in principle of the Pope and his authority as Pastor, albeit with some reservations in the area of obedience to his doctrinal authority and to the authority of the Council. Here I return to the distinction between individuals and institutions. The remission of the excommunication was a measure taken in the field of ecclesiastical discipline: the individuals were freed from the burden of conscience constituted by the most serious of ecclesiastical penalties. This disciplinary level needs to be distinguished from the doctrinal level. The fact that the Society of Saint Pius X does not possess a canonical status in the Church is not, in the end, based on disciplinary but on doctrinal reasons. As long as the Society does not have a canonical status in the Church, its ministers do not exercise legitimate ministries in the Church. There needs to be a distinction, then, between the disciplinary level, which deals with individuals as such, and the doctrinal level, at which ministry and institution are involved. In order to make this clear once again: until the doctrinal questions are clarified, the Society has no canonical status in the Church, and its ministers ‚Äì even though they have been freed of the ecclesiastical penalty ‚Äì do not legitimately exercise any ministry in the Church.\"\n\n\nHe makes it clear that the lifting of excommunication was a move of mercy, not an indication that the Vatican was wrong.

In the examples above, if you went to your friend's house for a meal, fully knowing they were going to serve you meat, just so you could, then it would be sinful.\n\nAs others have said, the society kinda keeps a position somewhere between the 1917 and 1983 CCL, so it's hard to pin down an exact position here. But, for ease of argument, let's assume that the society's position is aligned with Rome. Consult the CCL 1983 with respect to this - Canons 1244-1253.\n\nUltimately, it is down to the local ordinary to decide what days are penitential. This would mean that, for priests of the society, this power rests with the Superior General.\n\nFor the laity, it is your local bishop, or bishops' conference."

When I first started going to the society, about 10 years ago, there were some really toxic people floating around. When our district superior left the mainstream SSPX to join the resistance, these people left with him.\n\nThe SSPX I attend now is now much more aligned to the Roman Catholic church I knew when I grew up. One formed of many people from many backgrounds who share One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Faith and it is much less a secret \"club\".\n\nI also think that TC had the side effect of stirring up waaaay more division than there ever needed to be and the restriction on advertising the TLM meant that once again it returned to its position as being a \"special club\" for the initiated followers.\n\nI honestly think, in the next few years, the mainstream church may start to look at the SSPX as a model for success and, God willing, will start to reflect some of the things that we do and will slowly start to, as the great Pope St Pius X said, *\"Restore all things in Christ.\"*."

They have doubled down on this quote for 60 years, at some point you have to say \"this is their philosophy, this is not just a quote\".\n\n> This is the operational definition of being in schism.\n\nFirst, please read [ST III](https://isidore.co/aquinas/summa/TP/TP082.html#TPQ82A9THEP1): \"Whether one should take communion from heretical priests?\" (short answer: no). We are not in communion with people who formally declare the heresy that everything on earth should serve man - even if they're not yet excommunicated, as they should be for their apostasy. We are Catholics, they are - at least formally - heretics.\n\nWe are in schism from the Conciliar Church, not the Catholic Church. To \"schism\" means to cut yourself off (from tradition). Now, who cut himself off \"the Church\", they or us? Who invented a \"New Mass\", several \"New Rites\", a \"New understanding of Tradition\" - they or us? They were the ones who invented new, schismatic doctrine, a new, schismatic Mass, a new schismatic everything. We keep to the same, eternal faith. I think it's pretty evident who did the schism.\n\nTheir error is to equate mans glory with Gods glory. Mans soul (not body) was created in the image of God, but it was created to worship and extend Gods glory, not to be worshipped himself. Man is most definitely not the center of everything on earth. Second, man is tainted by original sin, so he needs Christ as the redeemer to be able .\n\n> There is no doubt there is a new mass, but a new church? If you believe that, go ahead.\n\nYes, they are a new \"church\":\n\n- A new philosophy centered on serving man\n- A new Hegelian understanding of Tradition (tradition now has to be constantly moving and changing and rock-n-rolling, otherwise it's a \"dead, static tradition\")\n- A new faith built on \"religious experiences\" (i.e. \"faith\" is now an experience, which explains their idiotic New Mass, to give people a good experience), which explains why there is now salvation in any religion\n- An ecumenist pope who prays together with Muslims\n- A new understanding of the priest being merely a \"presider over a meal\", not the Catholic understanding\n- An ecclesiology built on a co-governing Synodal Church, instead of the Catholic hierarchy of \"pope - bishops - priests - laity\"\n- A new, schismatic Mass rite\n\nIt is a \"Newchurch\", a ship of Theseus: At what point does it stop being the \"Catholic Church\" if everything that is Catholic is changed into something new, step by step? Is it then wrong to say \"this is not the *Catholic* Church anymore - we don't know what it is, but compared with 100 years ago, this is something else\"?\n\nThe term \"Newchurch\" was coined by Lefebvre, I believe (not sure). It's to express that whatever these people believe they're doing, it's at its core built on a new philosophy that puts Man as the center and crown, not God. There are remnants of the Catholic Faith in the Newchurch, but it's definitely not 100% Catholic anymore, in practice. They have the buildings, we have the faith and the faith is more important for getting to heaven.\n\n> I'm not a theologian and will not pretend to be one.\n\nMy comment was a very, very condensed version of [Prometheus: The Religion of Man by Fr. Calderon SSPX](https://angeluspress.org/products/prometheus). My comment was indeed based on a theologian. Read the book, it explains it far better than I can. Also, at least read the [Open Letter to Confused Catholics](https://www.sspxasia.com/Documents/Archbishop-Lefebvre/OpenLetterToConfusedCatholics/index.htm)."

The procedure has changed over time but the current procedure is the conclave.\n\nModern times aren't the first instance of having bad popes. Pope Benedict IX who was pope during the 11^(th) century is the only pope to have ever sold the papacy. He was initially elected due to bribery and his papacy was so scandalous that it led to a revolt by the Roman population. Pope Victor III in his third book of the *Dialogues* talks about\n\n>\\[Pope Benedict IX's\\] rapes, murders and other unspeakable acts of violence and sodomy. His life as a pope was so vile, so foul, so execrable, that I shudder to think of it\n\nHe committed multiple murders and had multiple adulterous affairs, all while pope. Saint Peter Damian, Doctor of the Church, wrote in his *Liber Gomorrhianus* about Benedict IX's engagement in acts of sodomy, bestiality and his frequent sponsoring of orgies.\n\nThis is not the only instance of horrific medieval popes. Pope John XII died while in the middle of the sexual act with a married woman. The woman's husband returned home and, while John XII was defiling his wife, he took a rock and caved his skull in with it.\n\nThe Church regards both Benedict IX and John XII as valid popes and if you deny that either were valid popes then you are a schismatic and a heretic.\n\nKeep these facts in mind when you ponder whether the validity of someone's papacy is determinate on such criteria."

There are some people who act uncharitably about the attire of others but it's thankfully an extreme minority. There are arseholes in every sphere of life, the traditional movement isn't immune from that problem. Generally people starting arguments with others because they don't approve of their attire is not looked kindly upon. It's petty, effeminate behaviour that's unbecoming of a Catholic to engage in.\n\nNow that said, everything I'm saying is within reason, but the cases that aren't within reason are extremely rare. You generally aren't going to be seeing people show up to Mass looking like they walked straight out of a nudist colony.\n\nThe standards in the diocesan Latin Masses are generally not as high so it's unfortunately not as uncommon as it should be to see women at the diocesan TLMs attired in a not so modest fashion, even by secular standards. I'm sure it does happen occasionally but it's definitely far rarer at SSPX Masses.\n\nIt's also heavily dependent on what country you're in and what the culture there is.

The closest ICKSP is several hours away, and I have hoped to visit it when I travel to visit a friend who lives close to it.\n\nThe priests at the FSSP parish neighboring my SSPX chapel are anti-SSPX. Certainly, they are not the only ones out there. As one of my priory priests has said, the opinion of FSSP priests about the SSPX varies from priest to priest. \n\nShort answer to the OP:\nI am willing to attend Masses of the Ecclesia Dei communities, but I still believe the SSPX remains the community who is the best at preaching overall and standing against modernism.\n\nLong answer:\nI used to attend the FSSP parish mentioned above for Mass or confession occasionally when my chapel (Mass on Sundays only) did not offer either, but I cannot bring myself to go anymore. As someone once said, \"Archbishop Lefebvre founded two orders,\" and, at the least, the FSSP priests should show some charity towards their roots, some gratitude towards Archbishop Lefebvre, even though they disagree with what happened and the SSPX's not only surviving but also prospering.\n\nSpeaking for myself, I will attend an FSSP church (other than the one above) or an ICKSP church if an SSPX chapel is not available. However, I do know hardcore SSPX attendees who will go ONLY to SSPX chapels. I disagree with that as they are making, in my opinion, the SSPX its own church and its priests as infallible; the SSPX has been disappointing in some areas in recent years and I will leave my thoughts at that. If you share with fellow SSPX attendees that you attend Masses other than those of the SSPX, reactions will range from shock, with perhaps some disgust, to, \"we go elsewhere, too, sometimes.\" I am careful with whom I share such information.\n\nHowever, in support of the SSPX-only crowd, I found sermons at the above-mentioned FSSP parish, when I attended, to be soft. Not in error, necessarily, but bland, as though the priests were afraid to speak out on the difficult issues most in the current public forum. The most recent bishop of that diocese was sadly quite progressive and dismantled two TLM communities as soon as Traditiones Custodes came out, so I suspect that could be the reason why their sermons were not as strong as SSPX sermons."

As you probably already know, there is a crisis in the Church.\n\nIf they aren't allowing you to make an official profession of faith, I would do something public to make it clear that you no longer adhere to the Eastern schism, so as to not cause scandal. For example, you could update your Facebook/Instagram to say \"Roman Catholic\". You should also go to confession and confess the sin of schism.\n\nIn the absence of more official options due to the crisis in the Church, I think this would suffice.\n\nI would also e-mail the priest at the closest SSPX church and ask them what to do, just to confirm.

        "body": "The response from Ferrari_Fan_16, critiquing the Novus Ordo Mass and referencing the SSPX, requires a thorough rebuttal rooted in the Magisterium and proper Catholic doctrine, always in union with Rome.\n\n\nThe Novus Ordo, promulgated by Pope Paul VI in 1969 following Vatican II, is a legitimate expression of the Roman Rite, approved by the Church‚Äôs supreme authority. Vatican II‚Äôs *Sacrosanctum Concilium* (paragraph 4) reaffirms the Church‚Äôs right to adapt liturgical forms while preserving their substance, ensuring continuity with tradition. The claim that it lacks fidelity to Church teaching is unfounded, as upheld by popes like St. John Paul II and Benedict XVI, who emphasized its validity and encouraged reverent celebration.\n\n\nSpecific criticisms such as the lack of enforced confession before receiving the Eucharist or diminished emphasis on the Social Kingship of Christ - reflect misunderstandings or misapplications, not liturgical defects. The Church teaches the necessity of grace for Communion (Catechism, 1385), with enforcement left to pastoral discretion. The Social Kingship of Christ, detailed by Pius XI in *Quas Primas* (1925), is rearticulated in modern teaching, as in *Gaudium et Spes* (paragraph 43), to address contemporary contexts.\n\n\nThe SSPX, however, has placed itself outside full communion due to its unauthorized 1988 consecrations, deemed schismatic by Pope John Paul II in *Ecclesia Dei*. Its rejection of Vatican II and the Novus Ordo contradicts the Church‚Äôs living tradition. Benedict XVI‚Äôs 2009 letter with *Summorum Pontificum* clarified that both the Tridentine Mass and Novus Ordo are valid forms of the same Rite, countering the SSPX‚Äôs narrative of rupture.\n\n\nThe accusation that the Novus Ordo and modern man are disobedient mischaracterizes the issue. Disobedience lies in rejecting papal authority and the Council, as the SSPX has done, not in the liturgy offered by Rome. True fidelity means embracing the Church‚Äôs full tradition, including its living Magisterium, under the successor of Peter, guided by the Holy Spirit."

Of course, they will ask where the hierarchy of the Church is, and I, unlike most Sedes, will say that there must be at least one Catholic diocesan bishop left taking office through common error, though I cannot name him. This is at least an answer to show that my position is at least possible, but the mainstream SSPX cannot pretend that they do not suffer from the same problem: a hierarchy which teaches heresy is just as problematic as no hierarchy at all, and the hierarchy the mainstream SSPX suggests has taught a huge number of heresies, frankly in a way that would fulfil the conditions of the ordinary and universal magisterium and thus be infallible. Invoking the Vincentian canon does not resolve this since the interpretation required is a novelty (See Cardinal Franzelin on this, thesis XXIV).\n\nIn short, no other explanation resolves the problem of an infallible Church apparently contradicting Herself and teaching heresy, or being prima facie an unreliable guide to salvation, giving the faithful poison, other than a long-term vacancy of the Holy See. The objection of the visibility of the hierarchy posited cannot defeat it as a heretical hierarchy is just as much of a problem as no hierarchy, and this whole problem is not explained away by so-called ‚ÄòR&Rers‚Äô without twisting Catholic theology and creating novelties."

See the text from Franzelin on the Vincentian canon in my post history). See Vatican I‚Äôs Dei Filius.

The very basis of the UPA argument which anti-Sedes constantly use against us is that the Church cannot adhere to a false rule of Faith, since then the whole Church would be led into error, which is impossible. The same reasoning is used by the theologians to demonstrate that the consensus of the theologians or of the Fathers cannot be erroneous, since their teaching is so connected with the UOM that the whole Church would be led into error if they taught it with a consensus, but since it‚Äôs impossible for the UOM to teach error, this cannot happen.\n\nFrankly, I don‚Äôt see why the people who attack this standard theology are so keen to be part of a fallible Church.

However, what would y‚Äôall say about the Eastern Catholic or Anglican Ordinance liturgy and practices (I‚Äôm aware some of them use Syriac(Chaldean and Maronite), Armenian (Armenian Catholic) Arabic (Melkites), various Slavic languages (ex:Ukrainian Greek Catholic or Ruthenians) )?

Latin is used liturgically because it's a dead language and dead languages don't change definitions, making it more difficult to mess with doctrine and interpret it in a heterodox manner.  Not impossible, but far more difficult.\n\nTake a look at the people who claim the US Constitution is a \"living document\".  It was written in modern English, yes, but it's closer to the archaic modern English, and the context of writings of the same authors is needed.  The \"living document\" interpreters seek to toss out context and change the meaning of the text for various political ends.\n\nThe vernacular of the other rites isn't an issue, as long as they stick to the Faith.  The problem with the Novus Ordo isn't that the SSPX clergy \"despise\" it for being in vernacular.  The TLM could be in vernacular instead of Latin and it wouldn't have most of the problems of Novus Ordo parishes.  \n\nThe Novus Ordo's biggest problem is that it was written as an experiment to attract Protestants by removing anything in the prayers that would be \"overly\" Catholic and off-putting to them.  The Church has long held to the time tested idea of \"Lex Orandi, Lex Credendi\", the way of prayer is the way of belief.  \n\nIt's why medieval peasants, though largely illiterate, knew their doctrine better than you'd expect.  The prayers reflect a greater fullness of the Faith.  The liturgy developed slowly and organically over a long period of time, not the result of some grand experiment based on bad assumptions.\n\nSince \"Lex Orandi, Lex Credendi\" seems to be true, most Catholics now act and believe more like Protestants do.  We have less Protestants converting than we did before the Novus Ordo was made available for use, and far more Catholics leaving the Faith.  Before, even if a Catholic did leave, they were less likely to become hostile toward the Faith, have misconceptions about it, or join a non-Catholic sect.  \n\nMarried priests are also just an administrative issue, not an issue of doctrine or dogma.  We used to have married priests in the West, but got rid of them because too many \"careerist\" clergy were leaving Church property to their children and overall cronyism was rampant."

The priests who wanted to stick to it were the ones who did not and they were exactly who went on to lead the nascent traditionalist movement.\n\nSure, some got sidetracked or went too far - but the traditional mass we enjoy now is a far cry from the state of it in the late 1950s. \n\nAnd I know this because I have relatives who were in their 20s at this time and saw first hand the attitude of many clergy. These clergy didn't disappear suddenly after the council (though many did) - these were the ones who adopted the Novus Ordo with gusto. And in whose legacy, many were unfortunately trapped."

        "body": "The insinuations that Archbishop Lefebvre was some sort of national socialist are ridiculous and as you point out deeply insulting to a man whose family was murdered in a German death camp for being a member of the French Resistance to the German occupiers. The Archbishop was a Catholic, and if anything was a highly reactionary monarchist like his father Ren√© was. Archbishop Lefebvre, as far as I know, supported a restoration of the monarchy in France. The German ideology is another strain of modern liberalism to which all traditional Catholics have always been opposed.\n\nFor foreigners, especially non Europeans and most especially Americans they generally haven't got a clue what actually happened in France between 1940 and 1945. Marshal P√©tain wasn't a \"nazi regime collaborator\". I mean you no offence but this is a child's understanding of modern history.\n\nMarshal P√©tain was a war hero from the First World War having been Commander in Chief of the French army. 1 week before France was defeated by Germany the French Prime Minister resigned and made a request to the French President, Lebrun, that P√©tain be appointed Prime Minister to help the government deal with the crisis. The government agreed and P√©tain was appointed, by the French President and government, to be the last Prime Minister of the Third French Republic.\n\nWhen France was finally totally defeated by Germany the government, including Prime Minister P√©tain, negotiated terms of surrender with the Germans. They managed to negotiate surrender terms where the Germans would directly occupy the northern half of France but would allow the southern half of the country a degree of self rule and autonomy, the legal entity of the French state continuing to exist but being basically under the thumb of the Germans, similar to how Poland and Hungary were technically independent countries after World War 2 but were de facto controlled by the Russians.\n\nP√©tain is a controversial figure. Some French people think he worked with the German occupying enemy. Other French people think he did his best to preserve what little autonomy the French government could maintain, and protected the southern half of the country from being directly occupied and controlled by the Germans. Regardless of one's opinion on P√©tain, the intention of his actions was to preserve that remained of France and to allow the country to survive without being totally destroyed by the Germans who had completely defeated them.\n\nThere were actual French collaborators at the time, people who were directly and intentionally collaborating with the Germans, not those who were doing what P√©tain and his government were trying to do. The German army and SS was full of divisions and brigades made up exclusively of French and also Bretons, such as the Charlemagne Brigade and the Bezen Perrot.\n\nSomething important to understand if you're not European and familiar with southern France during World War 2 is that the Catholic Church was very supportive of P√©tain and his government. The fight with the Germans was over, they had lost badly, but P√©tain and his government attempted to do their best to build a Catholic France in the territory the Germans hadn't taken from them. The Church made Her position clear, and issued statements telling all French Catholics that it was their obligation to support Marshal P√©tain and his government and that his government was the legitimate French government (i.e. not the Germans). French Bishops even went so far as to say that the French should obey P√©tain, not General de Gaulle who was attempting to restore the Freemasonic French Republic. Notably, and you most likely won't have heard this, in the early years of P√©tain's prime ministership the government voted to basically roll back the French Revolution. They renamed the state to the French State, or just France, rather than the French Republic and they even got rid of \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\" and replaced it with \"Work, Family, Fatherland\". P√©tain's Catholic government undid all the anti-Church laws passed since the 1700s and gave all the Church property that had been stolen by the Republic back to the Church. They passed laws allowing religion to once again be let back into public schools, and allowing public funds to fund Catholic schools once again.\n\nP√©tain was no perfect man. He wasn't really practising, \"married\" a divorcee and had multiple affairs during his life that produced no children. He did, however, with his government roll back much of the French Revolution and that is why so many European traditional Catholics think positively of him. Far from being a nazi collaborator, the Germans actually illegally arrested P√©tain who under the law was a foreign head of state and abducted him, taking him and deporting him against his will to Germany where he was basically a prisoner. P√©tain was motivated by an attempt to restore Catholicism, despite his personal failings, and to prevent France's total destruction at the hands of the Germans.\n\nTo the French who think positively of P√©tain, the Marshal and his government were victims of the Germans, not active participants in nazi German collaborationism. The Church made their opinion on the southern French state quite clear and have since then received mountains of criticism for their support, up to and including popes Pius XI and Pius XII. P√©tain isn't an exact 1:1 to Franco but he is in some ways the French version of general Franco.\n\n>Honestly though I can imagine Bishop Williamson having these views since he publicly denied the holocaust and got kicked out of the SSPX for refusing to stop commenting on it among other things.\n\nA correction on this, Bishop Williamson wasn't expelled from the SSPX for his view on World War 2. He was sanctioned basically for a lack of obedience to his lawful superiors. He administered over 100 confirmations in Brazil without permission, and against instruction from his superiors which was one of the big acts of disobedience. Another was when he circulated an open letter calling for the Superior General to resign. His World War 2 views were certainly not universally shared but they were ultimately besides the point, he was expelled for disobedience. The Society put out a statement basically saying that Bishop Williamson had gradually distanced himself from the Society's leadership and government over a period of a few years and refused to show the respect and obedience deserved by his legitimate superiors. You can probably find the letter online if you search for it."

What should Lefebvre have backed instead: the liberal Jewish communists of the 1920s or the social-communist Jewish-Russian atheists? Lefebvres father was convicted to death because he was a spy for British intelligence, any other nation did the same to spies, and worse.\n\nNazis mainly removed the Judeo-Masonic Republican government that occupied France in the 1920s and left France mostly to itself during their \"occupation\" (more of a liberation, really). They even respected France so much that any soldier raping French women was put to death (can't say that about the Russians). 1920s France was EXTREMELY degenerate, same as Weimar Germany, thanks to the ruling Jews. So, of course Lefebvre backed Petain, Franco and collaboration with the Nazi regime over collaboration with Russian communism and liberal degeneracy. Because if the Nazis / Francoists are known for one thing, it's that they absolutely hated degeneracy, unlike the communists.\n\nThe Nazis didn't have particularly Catholic ideals, I'll give you that - but they to some extent at least respected the Church / Christianity to exist (unlike liberals and the Jewish communists). Now please don't cite me the misguided Pius XIs bull, who himself engaged in Ostpolitik with Russian communists, nerfed the Cristeros by promoting compromise (thanks to Gasparri) and falsely excommunicated the Action Francaise (Pius XII kindly reverted that mistake, but by that point it was too late). Pius XI condemned nationalism and thought he could \"talk it out\" with the communists, only to leave a complete mess to his successor who had to find out the hard way that communists simply demand more concessions if you give them what you want. Anyone who will now post \"mit brennender sorge\" to paint Nazi Germany as the supposed mortal enemy of Catholicism will get ignored until he [reads up on some more history on Pius XI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VimsP2I-uFE). The more I study Pius XI, the worse it gets, really. One cannot be nice to communists and at the same time further Catholicism, it doesn't work. That's not an endorsement of NatSoc, by the way.\n\nLots of people are still so brainwashed on \"muh Nazis are literally devils murdering anyone while Jews were innocent lambs who did nothing\", it's amazing how deep the brainwashing goes. Lefebvre was simply redpilled on the fact that Judeo-Communist Masonry hates the guts of Catholic monarchy, so obviously he backed Petain / Franco (both monarchist) rather than de Gaulle (a Republican) and saw collaboration with Nazi Germany as the lesser problem to Catholicism. Williamson continued that and spoke the truth about the Jews - obviously that will get you hated in the modern world, which is sadly controlled by Jews.\n\nLefevbre did preach on the Judeo-Masonry and on freemasons in Econe, but obviously the Fellayite-SSPX won't tell you that anymore, since they believe in Holocaustianism and being nice to Jews. So currently (post 2012), they just try to ignore the issue, thinking they can play both sides. It really comes down to whether you believe the mainstream Holocaust narrative, and that's it. Once you start questioning that, both Lefebvre and Williamsons actions start to make sense. If you still believe the Jews are innocent little lambs slaughtered by the bad evil Nazis, then I can't help you and you'll never understand Lefebvres quotes. But they don't need to be \"excused\" or \"defended\", both of them spoke the truth."

Many find it hard to actually imagine people at the time existing within a specific historical context. Their thinking is Cartesian: \"Either they were for Hitler or they were against him!\" Roman Catholics (whether historians consider them traditionalist, conservative, liberal, or otherwise) were consistently harsh critics of Hitler and the NSDAP even if this had to be balanced by:\n\n1. **Threat of a fascist [Kulturkampf](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08703b.htm) -** The German government and various anticlerical factions had already tried to systematically erase Catholicism from public/economic life. They *failed* but not for lack of enthusiasm. Meanwhile the NSDAP welcomed Lutherans, Calvinists, neopagans, atheists, agnostics, Gnostics, and [literal occultists.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thule_Society) The strongest bases of support were in the most anti-Catholic areas and vice versa. Hitler himself vacillated between affirming all Germans' religious freedom and proclaiming that Christianity was a \"Jewish slave creed\" and expressing praise for Islam's \"warriors.\" \n\n2. **Potential for the USSR to expand -** The French Revolution already facilitated a continent-straddling campaign to supplant the Roman Catholic Church and put [deism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism#Deism_in_France_and_continental_Europe) (among other bad ideas) in the place of Christianity. Communism (rightfully) seemed roughly as scheming and ill-advised. The Russian Civil War produced numerous horror stories of murder and torture. During the Spanish Civil War, anarchists were burning down farms and small businesses while Leninists were promising to seize every bit of life and land from those with holy orders. The KPD didn't seem like a lesser evil to European Christians. \n\n3. **Fear of a Second Great War -** World War I was extremely destructive and traumatic. Not since the [European Wars of Religion](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14648b.htm) had people seen such destruction. It's easy to be an armchair general and say that the Third Reich should've been confronted sooner/harder, but even the USSR who saw Germany as their worst geopolitical competitor carefully stalled so that their system could industrialize, the Red Army could further militarize, and Soviet agents could ply allies around the world. The Roman Catholic Church herself had her ability to act as international authority progressively whittled away for decades in the name of nationalism/liberalism/commercialism. \n\nI could make this list longer but these are the three biggest reasons. SSPX has denounced the French Revolution for good reason. One can draw a line from Luther to Robespierre to Bismarck to Hitler."

The Church has always been surrounded by enemies on all sides yes, no one denies that, but that took a more active and direct sense after the protestant rebellion. In the aftermath of the First World War the Church was truly under siege by numerous hostile enemies. The Church was like a man locked in a prison cell with 3 felons: liberalism, communism and national socialist / fascist ideology, all of whom are in a 3 way fight to the death, meanwhile the Church is trying to both defend itself and avoid getting hit or caught in the crossfire in this death struggle. The only thing that changed after world war 2 was that the death struggle lost 1 participant and became a 2 man fight, both of whom still totally hostile to the Church.\n\nEvery single one of the ideologies that were battling for supremacy between World War 1 and the end of World War 2 were children of the French Revolution and its liberalism, who were themselves children of the protestant rebellion. They all changed over time but on the genetic tree they originated from the exact same poisonous point.\n\nCatholics during this period did all they could do, their best. Late in the war when the Germans took more direct control over Italy it became even more difficult of a situation. The Germans basically turned the pope and the Vatican into a hostage. There were [SS plans to invade the Vatican, sack it, steal all of the valuables, arrest the pope and kidnap him to Germany](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-5XSCiBHms). The more things change, the more they stay the same. The Papacy in Rome has for most of its history been surrounded by hostile powers trying to kill each other, and sometimes trying to kill the Papacy. There's very little difference between barbaric pagan German tribes killing each other over who gets to loot the corpse of the Western Roman Empire and.... barbaric pagan German tribes wearing SS uniforms using the Colosseum as an arms dump.\n\nThe whole nazis as demons thing is quite accurate, it's essentially an American new age religion. And, especially egregiously among Catholics, it fails to recognise that the German side in that three way death struggle is not the only one that was hostile to the Church. The other two also were, and still are. The forces that vanquished them are even worse enemies to the Church in many ways, especially the communist side of the conflict.\n\nAt the end of the day you have to wonder, what exactly do some of these ideologues want the pope to have done? He is the vicar of Christ, not a global dictator whose job it is to personally step in every time an unhinged madman whose brain is tainted by an ideological fruit of the French Revolution goes on a rampage. We as Catholics don't believe in utopianism, or that it is even possible to have a utopia on Earth. We know these sufferings won't end. What our primary job here is is to preserve the Church and the faith, regardless of how badly the society deteriorates philosophically, politically and ideologically. Minds tainted by libralism cannot comprehend this."

I do think that he was a holy man, and a heroic great man figure, but he wasn't a demigod and it's not only unrealistic but also unfair to treat his memory as if he was. No one can hold up to the standard of perfection and it's in a way uncharitable to try to hold someone to that.\n\nThe fact that we are flawed beings is what makes acts, and lives, of heroic greatness even more admirable. Heroic virtue practised by an angelic being of pure goodness is far less admirable than the same being managed by a being who has to struggle against original sin."

He is the vicar of Christ, not a global dictator whose job it is to personally step in every time an unhinged madman whose brain is tainted by an ideological fruit of the French Revolution goes on a rampage. We as Catholics don't believe in utopianism, or that it is even possible to have a utopia on Earth. We know these sufferings won't end. What our primary job here is is to preserve the Church and the faith, regardless of how badly the society deteriorates philosophically, politically and ideologically. Minds tainted by libralism cannot comprehend this.\n\nThere's a Catch-22 among liberal Christians. Catholics are principled pillars of their community embodying the love of Christ when they give women and children aid but Catholics are treated as clericalist cretins when they say that abortion is hostile to womanhood and childhood. They may even see the *former* as unacceptably intrusive. I suspect this is a factor behind how a lot of United States' Roman Catholic organizations are under the sway of social democrats, liberals, and neoconservatives. Classical conservatism, social traditionalism, and post-liberalism are treated like black sheep of public-facing church life. The winds may be turning though."

Bishop de Gallereta once called that \"gift\" by Rome \"a poison pill\", as I've been told, because it changes the jurisdiction from \"emergency\" back to the Pontiff, as if the emergency is over and can be simply ignored.\n\nNow, I don't recommend going to sedevacantists (sedes are wrong, but that's another topic), but since the confession is licit (thanks to emergency), it depends on whether the priest is a valid priest. CMRI priests are Thuc-line, which derive their priests from Guerard de Lauriers. [Thuc line bishops are definitely valid](https://archive.is/wip/OysPa), there's an extensive examination by Bp.

The first one that did not have documents of the other popes in there, but only Paul VI. \n>\n> It was a new book with a new mass, a new rite, Paul VI said so himself. And the book says, \"I like this,\" and there are only two points of decree: one is, from now on, there are four Eucharistical Prayers. It doesn't say we have to use them. It says, \"There are four Eucharistical Prayers, and I want the formula of consecration, the words of consecration, to be the same in all forms.\" That's the only part of the decree. \n>\n> So that concerns, again, the book itself, but not the use of the book or the obligation to use it. The obligation to use the Roman Missal was pronounced by Pope Paul VI orally in his speech at the consistory of May 26, 1976, and before that, there was a notification of the congregation. Now, I'm sorry, I got *Quo Primum* of Pius V saying, \"No new mass must ever be written up. This document cannot be changed.\" And then there's a notification of the congregation saying I have to use the new missal. The notification is null and void. *Inferior non potest tollere legem superioris*: an inferior cannot take away the law of the superior, and the congregation is bound to any pope whatsoever.\n>\n> -- Fr. Hesse, \"A conversation with Fr. Hesse, Part 1\"\n\nThis is classical liberal tactic: make it *seem* so that it is binding while actually never doing anything (and then using \"authority\" when it's pleasant to them to scare Catholics).\n\nAlso, as other said, they are heretics (same as the FSSP) by signing off on Vatican II. And communion in sacris with heretics is... well. See Aquinas: [\"Whether it is permissible to receive communion from heretical priests, and to hear mass said by them?\"](https://isidore.co/aquinas/summa/TP/TP082.html#TPQ82A9THEP1).\n\nThe Church‚Äôs indefectibility means she cannot *universally* promulgate error *as binding dogma* or defect from the Faith. It does not mean every papal disciplinary act is wise, prudent, or cannot be resisted if it demonstrably harms souls or the Faith. The Holy Spirit's assistance protects the Pope from *defining* heresy, not necessarily from personal error or harmful non-infallible actions."

It's kind of insane. \n\nPlease show one document of the Church which says to sift the Teaching of Peter.\n\nCasti Connubii\n104. Wherefore, let the faithful also be on their guard against the overrated independence of private judgment and that false autonomy of human reason. For it is quite foreign to everyone bearing the name of a Christian to trust his own mental powers with such pride as to agree only with those things which he can examine from their inner nature, and to imagine that the Church, sent by God to teach and guide all nations, is not conversant with present affairs and circumstances; or even that they must obey only in those matters which she has decreed by solemn definition as though her other decisions might be presumed to be false or putting forward insufficient motive for truth and honesty. Quite to the contrary, a characteristic of all true followers of Christ, lettered or unlettered, is to suffer themselves to be guided and led in ALL things that touch upon faith or morals by the Holy Church of God through its Supreme Pastor the Roman Pontiff, who is himself guided by Jesus Christ Our Lord.

If sources of error are plentiful, such as they would be in a society in which Catholics are the minority or in which there is a significant non-Catholic population, or in which contact with non-Catholics is common, then executing public heretics would do nothing to preserve souls because they would be insignificant compared to all of the other sources of error.\n\nAlso just to make sure you understand the history here. No one was ever burned or otherwise executed for privately having heretical opinions. The issue was people who insisted on trying to teach others their heretical ideas and continued to do so after being warned repeatedly to stop."

My family moved here a little over three years ago from Southern California and we are very happy here. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it was an adjustment, but well worth it. I also have some experience with the Dominican girls school across the street as well. Honestly, both schools are great. Your children will not get a ‚Äúworld class education‚Äù and the only thing constant is growth and change. However, with proper perspective on the world, The Church, and everything in between, I think that this school is great. The teachers are very good in my opinion. \n\nDM me if you want to chat more.

Since the ordinary universal magisterium(infalliable) is evident throught history, and the saints teach Papal resistence in error, either your wrong about this reading or the whole church MOU throught ages got contradicted by Pius XI.\n\nFurthermore if thats your criteria you should reject benedict XV whose avoided excomunicating heretics, and Pius XII whose elected people you call manifest heretics for vatican 2, and thr list goes on, until we get in the middle ages"

Are the New Canonizations infallible? To answer this, we‚Äôll need to see whether or not Canonizations in the past were infallible. It‚Äôs commonly understood by most Catholics that Canonizations are one of the things that are infallibly proclaimed by the Pope. How then can we square this seeming infallibility with some of the new saints, who contradict previous saints?\n\n>Note: This is one way of looking at the issue - theologians, in the last 250 years have had varied opinions on the infallibility of canonizations. It is still today, both in traditional and Vatican circles, debated.\n\nThis is the best explanation of the topic I've personally seen. The only difficulty you may have is Don Tranquillo's strong Italian accent.\n\nA brief summary is that since the entire canonisation process was changed under the pontificate of John Paul II, it's not the same thing that's being talked about in sources such as Saint Thomas Aquinas' writings on the infallability of canonisations. The new process is more doubtful than the previous one as a result, and due to that element of doubt (and until a truly traditional pope comes in and says yes, no, yes, no while going through the list of recent canonisations) it's imprudent to publicly venerate such people declared saints under the new rules. They may be saints, and it's perfectly fine to for example privately venerate Padre Pio and pray for his intercession, but public veneration due to that element of doubt is not prudent."

For us moderns, the most common definition is \"the right to do whatever I want as long as I don't step on anyone else's freedom.\"\nIf you think of it though, it doesn't really make any sense; because it would mean that preventing someone from doing something that's bad for him would mean reducing his freedom. Also, what exactly is the limit of how much you can't step on other people's freedom? Because insulting someone is part of my free speech; but one could argue he has a right not to be insulted; so where exactly is the limit? Well, there isn't one, that's the thing: people aren't bubbles walking around, we live in a society, every action we have, no matter how personal, has consequences, big or small, on society.\n\n\nThis is why the traditional definition of freedom is: \"the ability to do chose what's good\".\n\n\nSo, not letting someone chose something that's wrong for them (like for example, not letting a kid eating too much candy, or not letting a man commit suicide) isn't limiting their freedom.\n\n\nThat doesn't mean enforcing people to do what's good is always the good thing to do, sometimes it's even counter productive.\n\n\nSo that's the problem of \"freedom of religion\"; it implies that a Catholic state has a moral duty to accept any false religion and to let people spread it, no matter how evil that false religion is. And if you think of it, all of them are evil, since they lead people away from the true religion. Traditionally, the Catholic church accepts to \"tolerate\" an evil only when repressing it would be a greater evil (which is a common thing actually). A famous example is saint king Louis IX who wanted to close brothels; this ended up making prostitution even worse, because it was happening in the streets and getting out of control, so he decided to \"tolerate\" it (tolerate in the traditional sense I explained).\n\n\nSo yes, before our time, everyone in the world believed that it wouldn't make sense to have a moral duty to accept anything false and evil.\n\n\nThat's why freedom of religion is wrong, but forced conversions are wrong too; there is a difference between banning a cult and forcing its believers to get baptized!\n\n\nIf you don't agree with a part of what I said or if you want more explanation, don't hesitate!"

In cases where people are seperated from the Church and have sought after God there have been wonderful miracles that brought them into the Church.\n\nBecause people have free will the Church teaches that it is wrong to coerce people into being religious, which is not the same as freedom of religion.\n\nThis is an excellent video that covers the topic:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/AoZPouA8jxc?si=iGPMHhFXJol3d4NW\n\nThis is probably the most difficult Church teaching. I struggled to accept it until I focused on what I know about God. He is merciful, He is loving, He is infinitely more intelligent than we are. We can depend on Him to judge justly. We cannot trust ourselves and our fallen human nature to judge justly. We should always strive to use our rationality and intellect to understand and love God, but we are blind by comparison to Him."

        "body": "Nobody can be forced to believe against conscience (conversion at gunpoint scenario), but Vatican II goes in the 100% opposite extreme, saying that false religions such as Islam, Orthodoxy, thousands of Protestant sects (esp. Pentecostalism) and, by logical exension, even Satanism have a \"right to exist\". However, error non habet ius - error has no rights. The state is subordinate to the morals of the Church, as the goal of the state is to be an institution that leads people to heaven. It can't force people to convert, but it can certainly nudge people, promote Catholicism in schools, courts, censor books against the Faith, ban indecency, etc. \n\nThe core of this problem goes a lot deeper, starting with the Hegelian evolution of history, evolution of dogma, Napoleon separating Church and state, the new \"living tradtion\" nonsense that has infiltrated the Church for the past 300 years, etc. \n\nYour Dad is both correct and slightly wrong: freedom of religion is a symptom, the real problem is modernism (read Pascendi) or rather the rejection that absolute truth exists, whether I want it to or not. The modern Church thinks that religion is a subjective experience that is evolving and therefore we need to make the Church nice and welcoming so that everyone has a nice experience. Religion now comes from \"within\", from my personal experience of whatever I perceive to be. Therefore, we need a democratic church, as the faith now comes from the believers experiences, not from authority. That's a rough summary of modernism. What is right or wrong doesn't matter anymore as religion is merely an experience: of course other religions have their religious experiences, therefore they are all a-ok and deserve to exist. \"But that won't lead souls to heav...\" - oh shut up grandpa, nobody believes in that superstitious nonsense anymore."

New to Reddit this Priest (who doesn't use social media often) simply answered the question from an account he rarely uses. Immediately he received a notification message from a mod asking him for \"clerical verification\". When he did provide verification and the mods could see he was a Priest of the Society, they slapped the following restrictions upon him. \n\n> You are, however, welcome to participate in our subreddit, provided you do not reference any ordination/priestly orders, and provided you follow all our other rules. This includes not promoting the SSPX, and not \"promoting disobedience to Church teachings\".\n\nRecently he noticed a post in the AskAPriest sub, which was a question regarding the SSPX. It was answered by a Priest who said that \"SSPX clergy are still in the lay state\", which is obviously untrue. When he posted a follow up comment, it was removed because it's a forum for \"answers from Priests only\" and the question thread was subsequently locked, meaning members of the lay faithful will be left with grossly incorrect information. \n\nSurely if we are praying for healing of the rift between the Church and the Society this should show in our behaviour? But if this behaviour is anything to go by, it's likely this Priest will not answer anymore questions and his account will be shelved again.\n\nAny thoughts? ",

Some of the problem is ignorance and some of the problem is an unwillingness to correct in light of the truth.\n\nIt is the same as it has always been. Christ is persecuted and those who follow Him are persecuted in his likeness.\n\nI have found that the extent of the willingness to listen is commensurate with how aware they are of the crisis in the Church. The culture does seem to be slowly shifting in favor of tradition, though. I know in our parish we have been seeing a rise in attendance generally and from people from the NO, while the NO has continued to lose attendance. We have even had a fairly reasonable amount of conversions ‚Äìmyself being included among them.\n\nConsidering that the SSPX is the largest traditional group, that they are growing at a fast rate, and could be growing faster if we had the priests I think we can be hopeful of even larger victories in the near future.\n\nIt is the continued effort at dialogue that is bringing people in, so I would encourage Father to continue engaging where he can if he is inclined. The fullness of truth in an educated and well reasoned statement is compelling to those who are ready to hear it."

The Holy See considers the SSPX to be part of the Catholic Church.\n\nIf your conscience has led you away from the SSPX, that is fine with me. I have no interest in trying to convince you otherwise. However, I do think you ought not make statements that are at variance with the facts."

You'll also be able to find contact information. It's probably a good idea to go check out an SSPX Mass and to approach one of the priests afterwards and introduce yourself. The SSPX is a massive, global order and they get tons and tons of emails. In person you'd be able to talk face to face with a real person. The SSPX often have lunches after Mass so there's a good likelihood you can approach an SSPX priest in a relaxed environment without it being too formal or nerve wracking.\n\nThe SSPX, as all other orders do, have programmes for welcoming new converts into the Church. They run catechism lessons and undertake the formation of new catechumens. You could always ask your local SSPX priests if they'd allow you to sit in on some of these classes. Even though you're already confirmed I don't see any reason why they would refuse you.\n\nIt may be useful talking to people who attend SSPX Masses but there really is no substitute for getting it straight from the horse's mouth."

Anyone who gives you any answer other than yes is a modernist and is certainly not a traditionalist. These vile abominations should be rejected with absolute disgust and put where they belong, which is on the fire. I've done so on numerous occasions, and I would gladly and happily do so again if I were to come into contact with any other such texts in the future.\n\nThis is what His Holiness Pope Saint Pius X taught on the topic of protestant mistranslations of the Holy Bible and what should be done with them:\n\n>32¬†*Q.*¬†What should a Christian do who has been given a Bible by a Protestant or by an agent of the Protestants?  \n*A.*¬†A Christian to whom a Bible has been offered by a Protestant or an agent of the Protestants should reject it with disgust, because it is forbidden by the Church. If it was accepted by inadvertence, **it must be burnt as soon as possible or handed in to the Parish Priest**.\n\n>33¬†*Q.*¬†Why does the Church forbid Protestant Bibles?  \n*A.*¬†The Church forbids Protestant Bibles because, either they have been altered and contain errors, or not having her approbation and footnotes explaining the obscure meanings, they may be harmful to the Faith. It is for that same reason that the Church even forbids translations of the Holy Scriptures already approved by her which have been reprinted without the footnotes approved by her.\n\n[The quote is from the section \"On Holy Scripture\" in the Catechism of Pope Saint Pius X from 1910 A.D.](https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/catechism-of-st-pius-x-1286)\n\nDon't be surprised if you see naysayers crop up in the comments section of this post and not only dare to disagree with His Holiness Pope Saint Pius X's teaching on this matter but even go so far as to say that it's alright to read these vile texts. I've seen such clowns numerous times on this very subreddit. Never, ever forget that like all subreddits this place has open borders and that literally anyone can post here.\n\nHis Holiness Pope Leo X taught in his [Papal Bull *Exsurge Domine* in 1520 A.D. condemning the errors of protestantism](https://www.papalencyclicals.net/leo10/l10exdom.htm) that the faithful are to regard as condemned, reprobated and rejected these errors and that all Catholics are restrained in the virtue of holy obedience under the penalty of automatic major excommunication. His Holiness Pope Leo X forbid every one of the faithful, in virtue of holy obedience and under the aforementioned penalty of major excommunication to be incurred automatically, to \"read, assert, preach, praise, print, publish, or defend\" these texts. That includes protestant mistranslations of the Holy Bible.\n\nSo, to all you naysayers, enjoy your automatic major excommunication while you read the filth in the king james mistranslation and fanfiction of the Holy Bible. The rest of us will continue to read the Douay-Rheims and other actually Catholic translations of the Latin Vulgate, and we will also continue to reject your vapid suggestions that we join you in polluting our minds and souls by exposing ourselves such vile filth as you seem to do on a regular basis. Do us all a favour and cease your filth merchant carry on, or at the very least take it elsewhere."

I started attending the SSPX a year later and was baptized a year after that.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for my conversion was the cultural hegemony of modernist ideology. You can't hold any standards when you are a relativist. You can't be happy as a hedonist.\n\nReligion is the only way to be happy and to live a life that is internally congruent. Happiness is most strongly correlated with the virtue of love, so that lead me to \"Christianity\". \n\nI ruled out protestantism immediately, because it has no internal consistency. Every single protestant believes something different, practices their own way, and rarely improves. It's like a glass pane smashed to pieces. Everything is there, but it is disordered, confused, and broken. Protestantism is ultimately a modernist ideology, because it is relativistic.\n\nSo I turned to Catholicism. It celebrated love in a way that no other religion does. Everything that I learned was congruent. It fit together like puzzle pieces in a way that was pleasing and confounding. Some of the teachings confused me, but my lack of understanding didn't indicate that Catholicism was confused. As I continued to learn Catholicism quickly replaced any contending beliefs.\n\nWhen I attended the Novus Ordo I made several friends who were a bit younger than me. They kept complaining about the SSPX and how traditional they were ‚Äìtradition being the antithesis of modernism. I knew that I needed to go there when my friends proclaimed the desire for women to be priests. My friends were confused.\n\nThe next week I attended the SSPX."

There's little point in reading books etc. on something that will be entirely hypothetical and intellectual to you if you haven't actually experienced and witnessed what they are talking about at least a few times.\n\nI was raised nominally Novus Ordo but followed a similar trajectory in that I first merely preferred the Latin Mass and then stopped attending the Novus Ordo entirely. My stopping going to the new Mass had nothing to do with the SSPX really, and it isn't \"the SSPX position\" as you call it. Most traditionalists de facto exclusively attend the Latin Mass when given a choice. My attitude towards the Novus Ordo changed when I began attending a diocesan Latin Mass regularly. If a child is raised exclusively on highly processed frozen food their entire life and then later on is able to regularly eat real, homemade food for the first time they aren't going to want to willingly go back to the slop. It was a pretty obvious and self evident natural conclusion to me: if given the choice, why would I willingly go back to the novus ordo when the Latin Mass is superior by every metric? Why have a hamburger when you can have steak?\n\nI was largely unfamiliar with the nuts and bolts of the liturgy at the time, I was simply looking at what was plainly before my eyes. I have more substantial reasons for my attitude now but it began by just looking at what was in front of me.\n\n>So if you‚Äôre someone that left the NO for the TLM exclusively I‚Äôd love to hear how long it took you to assent to the SSPX position, as I don‚Äôt want to be overly cautious or reckless in the decision to leave or not leave the new mass.\n\nPeople attending the Latin Mass don't have to sign a contract at the front doors saying they will never attend the Novus Ordo again. Just go yourself and experience it. There really is no substitute for just going and seeing it yourself. Ultimately most people, the longer they attend the Latin Mass and are exposed to the traditional liturgy, end up naturally, in and of themselves, desiring to stop attending the novus ordo. It's not something we do to gain acceptance into some sort of trad club, it's a natural consequence of repeated exposure to a Mass that is superior to the novus ordo in every regard.\n\n>I have a wonderful parish community\n\nI understand why you're bringing this up but it that's completely besides the point. You aren't going to Mass, well at least you shouldn't be going to Mass, for the community. That's what protestants do in their made up fake religion. All the ancient pagans who converted to Catholicism did so despite suffering greatly socially, and they did it because it was true. It's as simple as that. We aren't Catholics for a social life, perhaps your diocesan seminary might not be communicating that to you but it's simply not what Catholicism is. A healthy community is a natural byproduct of people who are adhering to the truth who have gathered together but it's not the goal. Traditionalists who are going to the Latin Mass are doing so because they are interested in religious truth and they believe that's where they'll find it. They certainly aren't going out of their way to attend the TLM because they think it'll be good for their social lives.\n\nUltimately if you want to be a priest you need a more serious attitude. The primary purpose of a parish is to provide the Sacraments, not to be a social club. You're there to get the Sacraments and to receive religious truth, anything else is just a bonus. If priests spent a little less time pretending they're social workers and a little more time doing their jobs as priests the Church wouldn't be in as terrible a state as it is today.\n\nThe question of Latin Mass or Novus Ordo is ultimately about truth, not about how many friends you're going to make. If all we cared about was community none of our ancestors would have converted from paganism. I completely understand that what you said about community is only one part of your post but I in complete sincerity say to you that it's important to examine your emotional motivations when appraising the situation before you. We are all humans who can be easily swayed by our attachments to the things of this world, but ultimately the call of the Christian is to attempt to look beyond those worldly pushes and pulls and to try and seek the truth. If the question of \"what is the community like\" is even entering your mind when considering the question of whether you should attend the Latin Mass or the novus ordo then I sincerely say to you that you most probably need to take time to consciously reexamine your calculus and the motivations influencing your thought process."

(Unless the Masses offered locally were worse than they are.) Plus I do get to hear Scripture and the Gospel. My local NO parishes have the usual problems: Immodest and/or sloppy dress, Eucharistic ministers, Communion in the hand, awful modern music, women handling the ciborium and opening/closing the tabernacle, female lectors, and so on. It's depressing and makes me appreciate the TLM and SSPX more.\n\nSome circumstances have cut down drastically on my ability to travel to the SSPX chapel so I've been attending a local parish since last year. However, the parish I attend (populated by some other \"refugees,\" as I call them, from our former parish run by a couple of priests who are likely a couple) is dying. Two of three Masses are maybe 1/4 full, the largest maybe 1/3 full. It has a lot of debt, too. I give it two years before it's closed. Ironically, so I heard, that before Traditiones Custodes, this parish was going to get one TLM. It has the three steps to the altar, and the lack of an altar rail could easily be remedied by a few kneelers. If it had the TLM, I'd instead give it two years to flourish.\n\nAnyway, I know my SSPX friends would be horrified that I attend an NO. I'd also tell them that if they were so bothered by it they could come pick me up drive me there and back. I doubt I've have takers.

        "body": "I'm not wading into the debate on whether one should attend the Novus Ordo or not, but I do want to address what you said about validity. I know you know this, but for the benefit of those reaidng, it's not that the SSPX or most trads think the Novus Ordo is invalid. It's not, when done according to the text.\n\nThe SSPX view that Catholics should not attend the Novus Ordo derives from, and is in line with, what had always been traditionally believed about the obligation to attend Mass. When you essentially said, paraphrasing, that since it's valid and the Real Presence is truly there that you \"can't not be there\" is completely out of step with Catholic teaching. The Eastern Orthodox have valid Mass, would you also say that you \"can't not go\" to an Orthodox divine liturgy? The Arians had valid liturgy too, as did most schismatic groups in history. It's obviously not true that mere validity is enough to bind, or even enough to indicate you should attend. When many Greeks schismed from Rome there were also many who didn't, and the two groups used the same liturgy. Just because the Eastern Orthodox schismatic Greeks were using a good liturgy did not mean that it was okay to attend their Mass either.\n\nIn actuality the traditional teaching on the Sunday obligation was rather lenient to the laity. Generally speaking the norm was that the laity were dispensed from their obligation in a few cases. Serious illness, very far travel distance etc. One of these cases was if attending said Mass presented spiritual danger, for example if the priest is a known heretic who denies dogma. Catholics living during the Arian heresy or the Nestorian controversy were not, for example, bound by Sunday obligation to attend an Arian or Nestorian Mass. The idea is ludicrous. Church law is ultimately, in its most basic principle, ordered for the good of your soul. It cannot bind you to do something which is bad for your soul.\n\nThe actual debate among traditionalists is whether the Novus Ordo, in and of itself, when you completely set aside *how* it is said but only take into account what specifically the Novus Ordo is at its core, falls under that broad category. Some traditionalists think that if a Novus Ordo is celebrated with minimal liturgical abuse that it does not constitute something that is damaging or dangerous to the faith of those who attend and thus it does not dispense from the obligation. Other traditionalists, including the SSPX, believe that the Novus Ordo has intrinsic problems that are not effected by how it is said, but rather are part of its very DNA and that those problems do constitute danger and potential damage to the faith and souls of those who attend.\n\nWhat your opinion on the debate is is one thing, but it's important for everyone to be on the same page and for us to be clear about what the debate in question actually is. The SSPX isn't subjectively saying, based on the authority of their own opinions, that people shouldn't go because it's bad. What they are saying is based on the constant position of the Church from the very beginning, that Catholics are not bound to attend a Mass which presents a danger to their souls or is potentially damaging to their faith; their view, having studied the Novus Ordo extensively, is that such danger and potential damage is present within the DNA of the Novus Ordo, regardless of how it is said. That is why they give spiritual guidance on the matter to the effect that the Novus Ordo cannot bindingly obliate a person to attend it, given that in their view it is inherently dangerous and potentially damaging so it is incapable of exerting a binding obligation.\n\n>Anyway, I know my SSPX friends would be horrified that I attend an NO. I'd also tell them that if they were so bothered by it they could come pick me up drive me there and back. I doubt I've have takers.\n\nAnd have you tried asking? It sounds like you haven't."

    "selftext": "Fr. Aumann O.P. is considered by traditionalists a sound Dominican theologian from before Vatican II who codified Mystical Theology. There can be no doubt that his credentials are traditional. I have been aware for a while now that Infused Contemplation is the physical manifestation of the presence of God in the soul (the heart) so that you knew that God was physically present (it relates to 'Did our hearts not burn within us'). This is a common theme in pre-Vatican II spiritual writings. I was looking for evidence that this was true and then found this definition (see below) by Fr. Aumann O.P. that validates what others say about infused contemplation. I wondered why the SSPX do not teach this. Whilst it is clear that not everyone will experience infused contemplation, all the major spiritual theologians (like Fr. Garrigou-Lagrange) state that Infused Contemplation is necessary for the heights of holiness. As this is agreed on by all the main pre-Vatican II spiritual theologians, and it is necessary for the heights of holiness, then why do the SSPX not teach it? After all they are saying all the time that we have to reach for the heights of holiness. I researched the internet and the SSPX do not teach this, and I have never heard it directly from the SSPX priests.\n\n**Fr. Aumann O.P. A Spiritual Theology**\n\nCharacteristics of Infused Contemplation\n\n1. An experience of the presence of God. Many authors of mystical theology place great emphasis on this characteristic and consider it the essential note of infused contemplation. God gives to the soul an experimental, intellectual knowledge of his presence. This characteristic is essential for mystical contemplation but not for mystical experience in general because the soul may lack the experience of the presence of God when it is undergoing the passive purification of the soul, which St. John of the Cross describes as a \"purgative\" contemplation.(14)\n2. The invasion of the soul by the supernatural. The soul feels in an unmistakable manner that it is permeated with something it cannot describe with precision, but feels clearly is something supernatural. It is, in fact, an effect of the operation of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which inundate the soul with supernatural life.",

The SSPX says that option #1 is often possible, but that certain statements of Vatican II cannot be reconciled with traditional Catholic doctrine, so that option #2 is the only possible way to explain those statements.\n\n(\\*) This should not be interpreted as implying that a council can contradict previous Catholic doctrine by defining a new dogma.

Your theory leads to a situation where either the heretic Pope would retain his authority (sedeprivationism) or that the church would lose its Head (sedevacantism) \n\nBoth results are condemned by Vatican I, so by the fruit of that argument, it fails."

Coronata states the following:\n\n‚ÄúAppointment to the Office of the Primacy ‚Äî What is required by divine law for this appointment‚Ä¶ Also required for validity is that the one elected be a member of the Church; hence, heretics and apostates (at least public ones) are excluded‚Ä¶‚Äù - Institutiones Iuris Canonici [1950]\n\nAs to this claim about mechanism: the reason that a heretic cannot be elected is that one cannot be the head of a society without being a member of it, and a heretic is not a member of the Catholic Church, hence he cannot be the head of the Catholic Church. It is due to the Church‚Äòs nature as per the divine law, not any human legal obstacle. Therefore, there is no mechanism; the election simply holds no force. Practically speaking, a person who illegitimately intrudes upon the Holy See (i.e. has the appearance of occupying the office) must be deposed by a council of bishops, but this does not mean that such a person would have been Pope prior to the deposition. In fact, it is impossible since a true Pope can be judged by nobody; only an illegitimate intruder who is not the Pope could be deposed by the bishops.\n\nAs to being condemned by Vatican I, I deny that. See the text I recently posted in which it is stated that Archbishop Purcell raised the question and was told that a heretical Pope would fall from office ipso facto."

This is a point of debate and has been for centuries (or longer). \n\nYour answer on mechanism does not suffice. \n\n>Therefore, there is no mechanism \n\n> must be deposed by a council of bishops \n\nWhich is it? \n\nI think you are muddling several ideas. Perhaps because it would be too lengthy to write out here, but you're not making distinction between formal heresy and material heresy or a distinction between a loss of ability to define faith and morals and a loss of authority over the Church. These are the differences between sedevacantism and sedeprivationism. What argument are you making? That Francis is and was a formal heretic or material heretic? That he has lost all power of the Papacy and ceases to be Pope or just his ability to define faith and morals? Is a council of bishops required to depose him or not? Additionally, until the council of bishops does depose him, are we required to obey his leadership when he speaks from his position of authority? What happens if he is never deposed by a council of bishops? \n\nI am arguing about the premise, but the conclusion and practical effects of these arguments can clearly show that the premise must be false. I'd also challenge your appeal to authority. The only appeal that works in this case is the appeal to Church magisterial statements or Scriptural teachings. Neither have appeared in your comments yet. \n\nPurcell said it was answered, he does not say by whom. This did not end up in VI. Secondly, I believe he is referring to a formal heresy and alludes to a loss of his infallibility to define faith and morals, not the loss of his authority. Thirdly, this is a private opinion that has not been defined by the magisterium and is still subject to debate."

        "body": "1. Neither material nor formal heretics are members of the Church; it is an inaccurate usage to call mistaken Catholics material heretics. Material heretics properly speaking are the baptised, typically raised in heresy, to whom the divine origin of the Catholic Church has not been sufficiently proposed, such that they do not adhere to the Church as their rule of Faith, whilst formal heretics are pertinacious. It is hard to see how a Pope could not have had the divine origin of the Church sufficiently proposed to him, nor know that Luther was wrong about justification, for example, but, to head off the argument that the Modernism/bad philosophy of the post-Conciliar Popes prevents them from realising the contradiction between the traditional teaching & the new teaching, such people would also be incapable of adhering to the Church as their rule of Faith, and would be material heretics, and as such would not be members of the Church.\n2. The anti-Popes of history were not Popes, yet they were deposed, hence, as I said earlier, it is not required that a man be Pope to be deposed from the Holy See, only that he have the appearance of being Pope. Deposition in the case of a putative Pope is the formal recognition that he either never held the office or has fallen from office ipso facto, not the deprivation of the office itself.\n3. There can be no separation in the person of the Pope of his authority and his ability to define dogma. Since you are making this distinction, it falls on you to cite a source that supports it. Otherwise, it is gratuitously asserted, and therefore gratuitously denied.\n4. My position is that Francis is a formal heretic and therefore that he cannot be head of the Church, but if he were a material heretic due to his Modernism, that would make no difference.\n5. The deposition by a council of bishops would be required to elect a true Pope for practical reasons, but it would not cause the heretic to lose office, since he is prevented from holding office due to the Church‚Äôs nature as per her divine constitution.\n6. No, we are not bound to obey him or listen to him before the deposition since he would not be the Pope prior to the deposition.\n7. Your claim that only magisterial statements or scripture can be accepted as authorities is simply not how theology works, but I refer you to Mystici Corporis Christi, Satis Cognitum, and canon 188.4 of the 1917 code.\n8. Things can and are known with certainty without formal definition, for example the existence of guardian angels, or that Christ had a sense of humour.\n9. To state that this question is still subject to debate is to ignore the fact that all but a handful of theologians agree with what I am saying. If it is still subject to debate (which was explicitly contradicted by a German canonist in his Lehrbuch on Kirchenrechts), it must be accepted that your side has been losing and a minority for some centuries."

    "selftext": "I don't want to sound dramatic with this story but I want to share it as the way Ive interpreted a series of events has convinced me that the sspx is where I need to be.\n\nAs concise as I can make it...\nI'm a 50yo Australian man that has never been baptised and have gone through atheism as a kid into playing at Satanist in my rebellious 20s then settling on a germanic  paganism up untill I was around 40. Never married and was in a couple of medium term relationships amongs the many short term. \n\nI Prayed to Jesus in desperation one night and started to read the bible. My 1st real wake up call in life.\n\n90% of who I was changed considerably over the following couple of years.\nOver the last 12 months I've really dedicated my time in researching the true tradtional Christian religion and had bought it down to eastern orthodox and roman Catholicism. That's where I hit a road block for many reasons.\nAfter looking into roman Catholicism I was unsure about the unchanged consistency of its more recent history. \n\nI found out about the couple of groups that still do latin mass and felt drawn back but was still confused about who and why? I continued praying and researching and emailing and speaking with the closest sspx people and local fssp people along with my local catholic \"regular\" people. The standard catholic literature didn't feel much different to the Anglican literarure I'd picked up a couple of years ago and the conversations I'd had with fssp weren't completly convincing in their conviction. I wondered if it was just me being stubborn?\n\nAnyway, my dad recently had a stroke and was diagnosed with brain cancer. \nI prayed in earnest asking for his outcome to be my sign. Hoping for best case outcomes for my dad but not asking for that. Just asking for a sign in all of this and that I'd dedicate myself fully based on this.\n\nWhilst looking after his house one day I found a town near his house had an fssp sung mass on that Sunday so I decided to go for the very 1st time, to church, for mass. Not just to meet and talk with clergy. \n\nDad had gone for surgery the day before and was in ICU recovering.\nThat morning his dog got out and I thought I'd be late but I found him in time and got him back safe.\n\nOn my way to the chapel google maps kept taking me to a locked gate and not the main entrance. I finally worked it out looking at the map but then my car choked and spluttered and wouldn't accelerate at all. It's 4 years old so very wierd with no history of troubles. \nI wondered why I had these road blocks put up stopping me from getting to this service? I left the car and walked the 2 klms around the block to the front entry. Followed a few people in and made it with 10mins to spare. \n\nI introduced myself the the man helping that day and told him it was my 1st time. He greeted me with a huge smile and big handshake and showed me the holy water to cross myself with, gave me printouts and a booklet and showed me in. He assured me to be calm and said to just do what others do and stay kneeling and pray whilst everyone else took communion etc. \nI prayed to God mostly through all the service but asked Mary to guide my prayers and aid me as I was completely ignorant and most likley not even worthy after my life of complete rejection of God, Denial of the holy spirit and unforgivable blasphemy against Jesus. \n\nThe mass was deeply moving and I felt like humbleness was knocked into me like i got hit in the head with an iron pole. \nAfter the mass I felt exhausted but filled with warmth and confirmation I'd finally done the right thing.\n\nBefore I left, I had a chat with a couple who asked what I thought as I was obviously brand new. After telling them my reasons for coming to the Latin mass and not the regular church, they quietly explained their reasons for attending this fssp parish was they needed to travel 3 hours to attend sspx but that was their fullest preference. They explained why and  They confirmed my thoughts with their stories as we spoke for 20 mins.\nOn my walk back to the car I got a call from my dad explaining he was feeling great, had movement in his limbs again that he didn't have pre surgery and he'd be coming back to his local hospital in 2 days. The surgeons were thrilled with his recovery and surprised with how simple the removal was. It was more bloodclot than cancer contrary to what they 1st thought. He's now going onto immuno therapy with no need for further surgery or chemo. \n\nI got to my car and rembered it had failed me on my arrival, but now armed with so much good news I determined to just look it over and call roadside assistance if I couldn't get it going. It's still under warranty. To my surprise it started 1st go and was as if nothing was wrong in the 1st place. \n\nMy thoughts on what had happened that day in the feeling something was trying to stop me attending and the \"coincidence\" of the great news about my dad, the car being fine and these people explaing their experiences with sspx make me feel like one of those people that testify in showy baptist churches. This isn't my personality.  But what happened is undeniably the sign I'd been asking for. \n\nI'm completely open to criticism here. Having been so anti religious all my life I'm still trying to find reason in it all but can't other than it is the sign I'd asked for.\nI told some friends this story and they laughed it all off as crazy coincidence. Cool, but coincidence. I told dad in a longer call that night and he said he'd asked God for a sign in all this. He's not a religious man. Baptised Anglican at his mother's request but his dad was catholic. Pop died due to injuries in ww2 not long after and I never got to meet him. Dad told me he was going to speak to the priest at his local catholic church (in his street) once  he gets out of hospital as, in his words \"I won't look a gift horse in the mouth\" ü§£. \n\nThe closest sspx chapel is just over an hour from me but I'm going to go and see them in the coming weeks. At least 3 hours from Dad.\n\nMy time is full with work, traveling 3 hours to Dads to look after his house and dog on my days off and soon to help while he recovers and regains his strength and motor skills. But I did just pick up a couple of different catechisms (st pious x, baltimore and 2nd edition of catechism of the catholic church) to read in the mean time.\n\nPhew! That was meant to be a short concise story ü§£\n\nAny advice and/or feedback is much appreciated.\n\n",

And it just doesn't make sense. Why would God make us pray in a language we don't understand?\n\nAre there any good and *serious* sources on this (aka. not some random reedit post or something like that)? Has anyone ever explored this topic?\n\nWhat's so frustrating about this phenomenon is that it holds souls prey to evangelicalism, as it is so obviously supernatural.\n\nThank you so much in advance for your insights :) God bless",

        "body": "If you are just beginning then start small and build your way up from there. A good starting point is the Rosary, it includes many of the basic prayers such as the Our Father and Hail Mary. A good place to begin is saying a full set of mysteries once per day, and over the days and weeks you will gradually begin to learn and memorise the basic prayers through natural absorption and retention. Starting in your native language and then learning it in Latin is recommended.\n\n\nThe Mass itself is one of the greatest prayers there is. The Missal is a good text for prayer. You can, in a sense, pray the Mass or pray the Missal. You naturally absorb it by exposure to Mass but it's fruitful to sit down and prayerfully read the text of the Mass, the ordinary first and foremost. More familiarity with the Mass will let you get more spiritual benefits out of attending Mass as well.\n\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien had the entire Mass memorised and on days where he was unable to attend daily Mass he would pray the entire Mass in Latin on his own.\n\n\nAs a note, the *ordinary* of the Mass is a term that means those parts of the Mass that mostly the same every Mass such as the Pater Noster. The *propers* are the parts which change most Masses, like the Gospel and Epistle readings, the Collect prayer etc.\n\n\nThe best advice I can give is to try not to overload yourself too fast. Prayer is like spiritual exercise. If you've never seriously exercised and you try to run for a mile you will be in bits, but if you slowly build up to it that same mile will eventually be far easier."

They basically took the money, and the property, and ran. \n\nThat's a complete lie and when I corrected you last time on this, you told me don't want to bother to read [the whole story](https://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/NineVLefebvre.pdf). Since you apparently cannot be bothered to read \"sedevacantist nonsense\" (aka a simple PDF), I've summarized your claims:\n\n## \"They were expelled for unrepentant sedevacantism.\"\n\n**Fr. Cekada**: While some of the Nine already inclined to the sedevacantist position in 1983, others did not. Fr. Cekada explains (pp. 4‚Äì5) that many of the main disagreements with Archbishop Lefebvre at that time concerned:\n\n- Use of the 1962 (‚ÄòJohn XXIII‚Äô) Missal vs. older pre‚Äë1955 rubrics.\n\n- The acceptance of phony diocesan annulments that the Archbishop had begun to recognize in practice.\n\n- Toleration of doubtful priests ordained with the post‚ÄëVatican II form (e.g., Fr. Stark, who refused to be conditionally ordained).\n\n- The archbishop‚Äôs sudden switch to a more conciliatory stance toward the Vatican II establishment ( ‚Äúnegotiations‚Äù with Rome) and imposition of new ‚Äúparty lines.‚Äù\n\n**Fr. Cekada**: Archbishop Lefebvre had taken a much harder stance against Paul VI than he took against John Paul II. The archbishop had evidently softened after Paul VI died (1978), and by 1979‚Äì1981 was negotiating with the Vatican for an arrangement‚Äîsomething the older U.S. priests (the ‚Äúhardliners‚Äù) rejected.\n\nIn early 1983, the Archbishop **threatened to expel priests even for not switching to the John XXIII Missal** (p. 6). The new demands caused major friction. The Nine‚Äôs March 25, 1983 letter to the Archbishop shows multiple doctrinal/liturgical reasons for the dispute.\n\n**Fr. Cekada**: A central cause of separation was the Archbishop‚Äôs willingness to bargain away important ‚Äútraditionalist‚Äù principles, such as unwavering rejection of the new sacraments, or unconditional refusal to accept the modernist annulment machinery. The priests believed ‚Äúloyalty to the Church‚Äù (and her perennial Tradition) outranked ‚Äúloyalty to the Society‚Äù or one prelate‚Äôs changing stance. Multiple issues were in play, many having nothing to do with whether any priest privately held the Holy See to be vacant. Indeed, by the time of the April 1983 ‚Äúshowdown,‚Äù not all Nine were yet fully sedevacantist.\n\n## \"They stole money and property, basically took everything and ran.\"\n\n**Fr. Cekada on \"Who contributed the funds?\"**: The chapels in dispute were (with one or two exceptions, e.g., Ridgefield Seminary) paid for by local faithful, not the SSPX‚Äôs European headquarters.\n\n- Page 2: \"With the exception of the seminary building in Ridgefield CT, the local congregations that we served contributed all the funds for the purchase and operation of these facilities. The overwhelming majority of lay members in each place supported our stand.\"\n\n- **Lawsuits originated from Archbishop Lefebvre, not from the Nine:** The archbishop demanded that all these local non‚Äëprofit chapel corporations be signed over to him (pp. 7‚Äì8). The Nine, whose names and local directors were on those civil corporations, refused, so the Archbishop sued‚Äînot the other way around. ‚ÄúHe sued, we sued back,‚Äù Fr. Cekada says (p. 2).\n\nThus, the idea that the Nine ‚Äúran off with property‚Äù ignores the fact that **the Archbishop was the one who first went to the civil courts to take local chapels away from them**. After four years of complicated legal battles across multiple states, they settled. \n\nSome chapels ended up with the Archbishop/SSPX. Others remained with the priests and faithful who opposed the Archbishop. An actual payment was made to the Archbishop/SSPX: they accepted $350,000 (later effectively $205,000 after the new mortgages). This was a ‚Äúbuy‚Äëout‚Äù arrangement so that property disputes would cease.\n\nBoth parties signed a legal release settling all claims. The PDF states, ‚ÄúOnce SSPX did so and actually accepted money from us, the principles of Catholic moral theology on 'condonation' require that SSPX and its supporters **forever refrain from claiming that the Nine 'stole' property from them.** For the discounted price of $205,000, we bought ‚Äòem out, fair and square.‚Äù (p. 13).\n\nSummary:\n\n- No court found ‚Äúfinancial fraud‚Äù by the Nine.\n- Both sides ended with certain properties.\n- The faithful at those chapels, by large majority, wanted the Nine to remain and did not regard them as thieves.\n- The final settlement involved money going to the Archbishop‚Äôs side.\n\n## \"They pocketed leftover money that didn‚Äôt belong to them.\"\n\nThe parishes in question customarily formed lay, non‚Äëprofit corporations in America. The original purchase cost of these chapels was generally raised from local faithful, under local boards; this was standard among independent Traditional Catholic missions in the 1970s‚Äì80s, particularly to prevent a future ‚Äúsell‚Äëout‚Äù to the diocesan establishment.\n\n- No direct evidence in any lawsuit proved that the Nine were using parish money for personal gain. \n\n- The Archbishop‚Äôs side alleged that the Nine were ‚Äútrustees‚Äù or ‚Äúagents‚Äù who held property on behalf of the SSPX, but: They never obtained an official ruling supporting the notion that the Nine personally ‚Äúpocketed‚Äù sums.\n\nIn fact, the judge eventually pushed the parties to settle, seeing that **the corporations and property were predominantly funded and deeded by local people, not by the European Society**.\n\nConclusion: There is **nothing** in the lawsuits or in the PDF to substantiate that the Nine ‚Äúpocketed‚Äù leftover funds or spent them on themselves. On the contrary, the final buy‚Äëout indicates that money flowed the other way: **the Nine‚Äôs corporations paid the Archbishop/SSPX to finalize settlement**.\n\n## ‚ÄúThey refused to repent of sedevacantism.‚Äù \n\nSedevacantism was not the only doctrinal disagreement. The 25‚ÄëMarch‚Äë1983 letter from the Nine to Archbishop Lefebvre had six major points about practice and doctrine. ‚ÄúRefusing to name John Paul II in the Canon‚Äù was just one dimension that had appeared much earlier (p. 3). Far more immediate in 1983 were:\n\n- The acceptance of phony annulments,\n\n- Use of John XXIII rites aka 1962 Missal (as opposed to the pre-1955 one)\n\n- Sanctioning priests ordained in doubtfully valid rites, etc.\n\n- Many of the Nine did gradually adopt a sedevacantist conclusion, not all were sedevacantist\n\n- Archbishop Lefebvre‚Äôs own wavering, trying to be a diplomat to \"get a deal\" with modernist\n\nSome (e.g., Fr. Jenkins, Fr. Collins) moved to that position later; some (Fr. Kelly) was reticent earlier; some (Fr. Cekada, Fr. Sanborn, Fr. Dolan) leaned strongly that way earlier.\n\nThe friction with Archbishop Lefebvre also hinged on the contradiction of the post‚ÄëVatican II popes making or permitting ‚Äúmanifestly heretical‚Äù changes to the Sacraments.\n\n**Fr. Cekada**: In the 1970s, the Archbishop himself said things that logically hinted at vacancy of the Papal See. He would disclaim officially that it was his position but simultaneously allow that ‚ÄúOne can say the Pope is not the Pope‚Äù (p. 3, quoting the Archbishop‚Äôs remarks). So the question was never so clear‚Äëcut as ‚Äúthey are purely unrepentant rebels.‚Äù\n\nThe break did not boil down to ‚Äúsedevacantism or no.‚Äù Some among the Nine ended as open sedevacantists after leaving, but the break originally had multiple causes. The PDF does not support that they were simply ‚Äúexpelled for unrepentant sedevacantism.‚Äù\n\n---\n\nAlso: **Calling other Catholics \"cockroaches\" for having doubts really exposes your own nature.** Note: I'm not sedevacantist myself, I'm with the Resistance, I even pray for Pope Francis - but I'm not going around calling other people \"cockroaches\" or lying. Please repent from your pride, especially in this time of Lent."

Initially, I felt called to the priesthood, but since the seminary in my diocese is extremely corrupt (doctrinally and morally), I ruled out that possibility. From what I've heard, SSPX would not accept me (I've heard of other people that tried). I've considered secular lay celibacy, but within that, I could not think of a very magnanimous way in which I, in my conditions and talents, could offer my life to God and to the brothers - it's hard to beat the priesthood and the religious life in this sense. And I see that people really need good priests. I am now a postulant in a monastery in my hometown, which serves several chapels in the city. My calling here would be to serve God and my brothers as a religious priest.\n\nBut, if I could, I believe I would choose the secular priesthood... I believe that many of you know the state of degradation in which many religious congregations find themselves. In this scenario, I don't see much point in cutting off ties with my family and uplifting friendships because of the cloister. Furthermore, the relationship with the superior ends up being more like that of a boss and employee (but every day and 24/7) than that of a spiritual father and his disciple, and the living with the other monks is not always the most edifying.\n\nFor this reason, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtaking perpetual vows in the monastery distresses me. While I am a postulant or novice, and even when I make temporary profession, there is a certain reversibility to the situation. But my fear is that after taking perpetual vows, the situation will change here. Whether another abbot will no longer allow certain contact with the family, or moral degradation will take over, or the monastery will close and I will have to be transferred to another city/country...\n\nThat is why I sometimes feel that I am not being authentic in my monastic vocation, but merely embracing it out of love for God so that I can serve Him as a priest.\n\nI have been dealing with this resistance with my spiritual director, but I confess that I am not getting very clear guidance.\n\nHence the question: under what conditions could I request a dispensation from perpetual vows?\n\nIf the monastery deteriorates further or closes and I have to be transferred to another one (considering that I am well-established in the city and chose this one precisely because of this), would that be sufficient grounds for such a request for dispensation?\n\nFurthermore, what advice would you give me in my current situation?",

There are some Catholic books of academic commentary on the Bible but most are from after the council. The Jerome Biblical Commentary is the most authoritative - **but** it is historical-critical which Leo XIII condemned in *Providentissimus Deus* but was liberated by Pius XII in *Divino Afflante Spiritu*. The 1968 edition is probably the least overtly modernist. It still has issues.\n\nWhat is the historical-critical method? It is a form of textual criticism that appraises the world behind the text - in effect, what were the circumstances that led to certain word choices.\n\nIt's up to you really. But bear in mind that prior to the council there basically was no Catholic biblical criticism and any group that was concerned with it before the council ended up embroiled in modernism. \n\nThe traditional Catholic way of approaching scripture is to read it in a prayerful way and listen to it and see how it works within the tradition of the faith as handed down, allowing God to speak to you through the words. The Catholic way of viewing things is that scripture and tradition must walk together to bring forth fruits."

But bear in mind that prior to the council there basically was no Catholic biblical criticism and any group that was concerned with it before the council ended up embroiled in modernism.\n\nWell, Bible study isn't really \"criticism\" as Catholics understand it - as a former Protestant, it's more like talking about certain passages, usually with someone more experienced highlighting parallels / cross-references, commentary, talking about common misconceptions, playing \"Devils advocate\", taking different positions, etc. Despite obviously twisting Scripture with error, it's ironically one of the few things Protestants are actually good at (the other one being organizing / networking). Catholics are more like \"I have to ask a priest for everything\", okay but priests are few and far in between and busy. Even Jesus was lecturing in the temple about scripture and knew it well to refute the Jews who tempted him.\n\nBible study is basically training in apologetics as you go along, not criticizing. If you don't train, you can't fight. Our priest occasionally does a \"catechism for adults\", but that's not exactly the same."

Infant baptism is only tenable if the people speaking on behalf of the child truly intend to raise the child in the Faith (not because it‚Äôs family/cultural custom to baptize, the parents are afraid of the child going to hell, etc).¬†\n\nIf your child is in danger of death then anyone can baptize, otherwise you need to have a priest baptize the child (it would actually be a mortal sin for you to baptize without the need to, and there is no penalty for delaying infant baptism at the direction of your priest).¬†\n\nThe Novus Ordo has lately been using delays to ascertain how serious someone is about practicing their Faith (eg long baptism prep courses, long marriage prep courses). Lots of people get on religious kicks and for a few weeks are super gung ho about everything, but then they run out of gas and go back to their normal, worldly ways. A priest administering a sacrament in this day and age needs to ascertain that that is not the case, that someone has a deep and sustainable desire to the practice the Faith. If you‚Äôre willing to wait a few months to receive a sacrament and follow through the requisite classes, then you probably aren‚Äôt going to be a flake.¬†\n\nThe SSPX doesn‚Äôt really have an established way of doing the same ascertaining, so it‚Äôs down to the individual priest. SSPX priests, for better or worse, will typically just have a conversation with you to figure out how serious you are about the sacrament in question and then make a decision there, not make you wait months.¬†\n\nIt‚Äôs certainly a faster way to get things done, but you should definitely keep in mind the fact that you and the godparents will be held responsible before God on Judgement Day if the child does not follow through with the promises made at baptism.¬†"

Go for it, you'll encounter obstacles but you won't regret it!\n\n\nVatican 2: the SSPX considers this Council as containing claims contradicting Tradition on 3 issues: ecumenism, religious freedom, and counciliarism. I can give more detail if you wanna, but you can find everything by just googling one of those words and \"SSPX\".¬†\n\n\nRegarding the NO, the SSPX uses the brief critical exam of the new mass as their main summary of their position (you can find it online on the Angelus Press site it's short and informative). Basically, it considers the NO Mass as going away from the traditional vision of Mass, and therefore thinks that we should back to the TLM in the entire Church. That doesn't make all the people who go to it without knowing how dangerous it has been bad people of course, that's an important point to keep in mind.\n\n\nAs an ex NO goer you'll certainly not feel alone, many people are among SSPX parishioners, and the rest love to see people who were brave enough to make that journey.

        "body": "> I appreciated those quotes and asked him why would Our Mother Church make moves towards ecumenism. \n\nWell, it wasn't Mother Church, it was infiltrating freemasons. They did plan it for more than 150 years, starting in 1717 with the French Revolution (against Catholics), infiltrating universities in the 1800s, launching Communism in 1917, liberation theology, etc. Which is IMO an argument for Catholicism, because why would judeo-masons conspire to infiltrate Catholics specifically instead of Orthodox, Anglicans, etc.\n\nA couple days ago, I was interested in what arguments Orthodox have against Catholics and I discovered [this site](https://www.trueorthodoxy.org/polemics/heretics_roman_catholics.shtml) from the \"Genuine Orthodox Church of America\", which lists ecumenism as \"a heresy stemming from the 20th-century Freemasonic takeover of the Vatican\". It's ironic that Orthodox heretics are more honest than even some Catholics. \n\nCurrently, there is a war between \"Catholic Authority\" (the people in the Church buildings) and \"Catholic Faith\" (the people outside of the buildings, but preaching the Catholic doctrine). To what percentage both are united, nobody knows. Sedevactantists say its 100% - 0%, Resistance / SSPX varies between 99% - 1% and maybe 80% Authority - 20% Faith (i.e. praying for the pope, but otherwise ignoring what he says until he comes back to his senses).\n\nYour friend - as I presume most diocesan-taught people - is indoctrinated to think that people outside of the Church building (i.e. the diocese, in submission to a modernistic bishop, in submission to a modernist-influenced pope), cannot be saved, which is wrong. In the end, the Faith is far more important than the pope. He avoided the question, but that doesn't invalidate Catholicism, it just means we're going through a very rough phase, in which \"cultural Catholicism\" is purged (good!).\n\n> Why would our Lord reach out to all the sinners and bring good news?\n\nHe reaches out to people, but he can't force anyone. He wants a heaven full of people, not robots. People are either going to accept or not. We must pray for them and try to be just, because the prayer of a just man is worth much more than the prayer of an unjust man. \n\nA lot of people certainly feel that there is something wrong with the modern world, but very few investigate. Very few dig deep down on what the issue actually is (people glorifying freedom, instead of using their reason to submit to Gods will). I've talked with a lot of people who came pretty close and then totally rejected some dogma (i.e. I had a Protestant that was close to converting multiple times, even prayed to Mary, and then turned around and said Catholics worship cookies, I just... anyway). They will go to hell (not a deep hell, but certainly not heaven), because they did not seek God with \"all their strength\". God cannot condemn anyone who tries his/her best to get to heaven. He can save people despite of their religion, even Protestants despite their error (not because of it). But many people fall into distractions, give up searching, distract themselves, etc. That doesn't mean it's okay for them to go on being Protestants.\n\n> I do not want to give up on Catholicism, and with all due respect to my friend, his comment was discouraging...\n\nWe are attached to the eternal Rome, not the temporal, infiltrated Vatican. Right now the pope is a Jesuit, likely immolated from a slew of yes-men and corrupt clergy since childhood. We say that \"yes, he's the pope, but his mind is basically a slush of ecumenism, modernism, trying-to-be-nice-ism\". When a good, strong pope cleans up the heresies of Vatican II, I'll be the first to hail the pope. I don't reject the papacy, but the \"submission to the Roman pontiff\" does not mean that we have to follow a weak pope into ecumenist error.\n\n> we just watch some videos, and no discussion ever occurs\n\nI wouldn't count that as \"good\" if no discussion is happening. Anyway. Read the [1910 Catholic Encyclopedia](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/), it's very solid. The Baltimore Catechism isn't bad, but you might not get all the context from your diocesan priest watching YT videos, as most non-traditional priests today are poorly formed.\n\nPray the rosary every day, get into practicing prayer, [Divinum Officium](https://www.divinumofficium.com/), [LOBVM](https://www.lobvm.com/), Jesus Prayer, etc. You can go to heaven even without the Mass (certainly useful if you have it), but not without prayer. Research apologetics and ignore any advice that encourages you in complacency."

The Church is the Ark of salvation, and everyone else is outside in the Flood: Protestants, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, atheists, etc.\n\nIt is theoretically possible for non-Catholics to be saved if they have \"invincible ignorance\", where they aren't culpable for their lack of belief. This is rare and not something to count on: the analogy that the Baltimore Catechism uses is a few people clinging on to the outside of the Ark with ropes. We are called to bring everyone we can into the Ark and save their souls.\n\nSince Vatican II, Church leaders have basically sold this dogma down the river because they think it's outdated, narrow-minded, and mean. Instead, they promote ecumenism, where basically you say that other religions are praiseworthy, that people can be saved without becoming Catholic, and you just endlessly dialogue with them instead of trying to convert them.\n\nThis has dramatically undermined both evangelization (if you don't need to become Catholic to be saved, why go through all the hassle?) and Catholics' own attachment to their faith (if being Catholic isn't essential for salvation, why does it matter if I don't practice my faith or switch to a different religion?).\n\nYour friend can't give you a straight answer because he would have to say that most modern Church leaders are wrong and are undermining a dogma of the Church, which he doesn't want to do.\n\nAs for advice, I'd recommend going to the closest Latin Mass. SSPX would be ideal. Don't go to the Novus Ordo. It sucks.\n\n[https://www.latinmass.com/find-latin-mass](https://www.latinmass.com/find-latin-mass)\n\nAlso, pray the rosary every day and read this book.

Romanian and Ukrainian ones can often be quite ethnic, but not all are; I go to a very non-ethnic Romanian mission (though I am canonically Romanian Greek Catholic).\n\nI can't speak as much for other Eastern Catholic Churches, but I would say that the Maronites are heavily latinized/modernized (though some of that is going back to tradition), and the Chaldeans and Syro-Malabars are somewhat that way too. The Armenian Church is one I haven't personally visited but I've been to an Armenian Orthodox liturgy and it is beautiful, so the Armenian Catholic one probably is, too.\n\nFrom the SSPX perspective, the Eastern Churches didn't have a liturgical reform in the way the Latins did in the 1960s-1970s, so I would imagine Eastern parishes would at least in some ways be more \"acceptable.\""

Add onto that the doubt about ordinations in the New Rite, bi-ritualism in the FSSP, etc. And if you take \"communion\" from such a priest (while knowing that he is okay with heresy), what does that make you in your Last Judgement?\n\nThe case with the Resistance members going to SSPX Masses is a bit of a false equivalent, because the SSPX has at least formally not signed off on heresy yet. The Resistance argument is that the SSPX is \"drifting\" in that direction and is therefore equal in \"shaking hands with Modernists\" to the FSSP already. Some Resistance priests like Fr. Hewko, also advise to avoid the SSPX Masses, for that exact reason. But in difference to the FSSP there is not a \"clear-as-day\" indication as there is with the \"full communion\" aka Ecclesia Dei communities (all \"full communion\" communities have to SIGN IN WRITING that they fully accept Vatican II). With the neo-SSPX there is always plausible deniability as the change was more subtle.\n\nI personally support Fr. Hewko in his opinion, because over the course of the last year the shift at my local parish got very obvious (my priest is a complete liberal, I can't trust him with my soul), but it's not as clear everywhere that \"the SSPX is lost\". Formally, the SSPX will certainly tell you otherwise, that they're still fighting. The FSSP will not tell you that, as they are \"in communion\" with modernist Rome and not fighting anything."

The doubt already is the fact that it \"can be invalid or not\". This doubt comes from the fact that we cannot look into the bishops heart, which is why even Novus Ordo ordained priests themselves ask to be re-consecrated, despite the fact that they might already be validly consecrated priests. There is \"doubt\" due to the rite, because with the new rite we cannot to 100% certainty know what the bishop intented, did he intend to create a priest or a preacher? That is what the word \"doubtful\" means.\n\nAlso, try and tell the lay faithful that they need to check every single priest, every single bishop, etc. In the old rite there was no doubt, in the new rite there is doubt. The SSPX used to require conditional re-ordination (at least up until their sellout in 2012 AFAIK)."

        "body": "Even though he was a sede, Fr Anthony Cekada's book *\"Work of Human Hands\"* is considered an excellent resource on this matter.\n\nThere are elements of the Novus Ordo that are from the traditions of the church - the inclusion of the \"Bidding prayers\" for example, is something that would have been fairly normal in the pre-counter reformation church. But it's more a matter of what the New Mass removes that is of concern than what the New Mass has.\n\nElements like the Offertory were radically altered to *de-emphasise* (because Bugnini knew that he couldn't outright deny) the sacrificial quality of the Mass. The prayers at the foot of the altar and the introit were removed entirely, the collects were changed to de-emphasise things that were *\"too Catholic\"*. The Offertory verse was suppressed outright. The Offertory was changed to remove references to transubstantiation and the sacrificial quality. The prayer to the Holy Trinity over the gifts was removed. The Canon was outright vandalised. The Canon is the oldest and singularly untouched part of the Mass. It was common to all expressions of the Roman Rite. It has its origins in the very words of St Peter. To reform it to be 4 \"Eucharistic Prayers\" really does damage the sacredness of this point of the Mass. This is a clear departure from the ancient practices of the church. The communion verse was re-branded as the \"communion song\" and the post-communion became almost part of the dismissal.\n\nIn terms of ceremonial, the new missal is a stark departure from what went before. The most striking is the shift from Ad Orientem to Versus Populum. Yes, the New Mass can be said, in Latin, Ad Orientem but that doesn't make it any better. Vestments like the maniple, the cincture and the amice were suppressed. Even really small things like the stole were reformed. In the pre-62 rites, a priest crossed his stole. Only a bishop was entitled to wear it straight down. The number of signs of the cross were radically reduced. The priest makes the sign of the cross 52 times in the 62 Missal. He makes it far fewer times in the 1970 reformed missal. The Gloria Patri isn't present in the new mass so there is no reverence at this point. The priest makes no bows at any of the Holy Names. The ringing of bells only occurs at the epiklesis and the elevation. The second Confiteor is suppressed. The Kyrie is now a back and forth and not a 3 fold reflection of church teaching. The priest and the people confess together (misereatur nostri vs. vestri/tui in the old Mass). The Domine Non Sum is only recited once. And the priest no longer strikes his breast at the Agnus, the Nobis Quoque or the Domine Non Sum.\n\nIt is also a false flag to declare the Missal of Pius V as a *\"creation\"* of the counter reformation. All Pius V did was formally codify the Roman Rite to ensure more unity in the church. But if one attended a Sarum Use Mass or a Dominican Use or even an Ambrosian, one would find they would all be strikingly similar - because they share a common origin. Pius V declared in Quo Primum that any liturgy with an origin of greater than 200 years prior to the Council of Trent could continue. He was actively suppressing the new forms of \"Mass\" that were emerging during the reformation that denied key Catholic teachings.\n\nSo, no, the new-mass is not a return to ancient liturgical customs. It is an entirely new creation entirely. It apes the traditional mass, but it cannot be considered a worthy change or anything to be proud of. It is valid, but validity is not the mark of quality. The position of the SSPX is that it is valid, but spiritually and intellectually deficient and that it poses a grave risk to the faith. I'd like to think that these fruits are coming forth and the SSPX are being thoroughly vindicated. Especially with research suggested 4/5s of Catholics do not believe in transubstantiation.\n\nIn terms of reading, alongside Cekada's aforementioned work, I'd also recommend Fr Adrian Fortescue's *\"The Mass: A Study of the Roman Liturgy\"* which gives a stirling overview of the development of the Roman Mass over the centuries."

No layman has to learn Latin to understand what is going on at Mass. It is not hard to learn to follow along with a hand missal, and even if you don't want to do that, it doesn't take much experience to figure out what it going on at various times in the Mass.\n\nHaving said that, however, even though the Second Vatican Council explicitly asked for Latin to be retained in the Mass, the change to the vernacular language is actually the least objectionable of all the changes made in the novus ordo Mass.

So, I did not make to the NO mass today( the only mass available localy). Instead, I came back home and read the Latin Mass, read the cermon for today. Still feel guilt for not attending the mass though. I did not attend the Mass a couple of weeks ago because I had to deal with some legal issues( thanks to our bylaws and governement)....\nIn case of uncontrolled circumstances and consequent inability to attend the mass( even ordinary form),  would it suffice to stay home and read the mass/pray yourself yo fullfill the obligation?\nPS. I am converting and not a Catholic yet( and strongly gravitating towards the traditional form)\nThanks for reading and God bless!\n",

My take away is even if the NO would have it that the obligation is fully dispensed by poor weather or health keeping the sabbath on our own is always the dutiful path.  Certainly there were (months) during 2020 and sporadically since this remained the only option in light of demonic circumstances blockading our reasonable passage to communal celebration of the Holy Eucharist."

    "selftext": "The SSPX priests I‚Äôve spoken to have said that it‚Äôs better to never attend the NO (other than for social functions like a wedding, funeral, etc).\n\nI‚Äôve read various SSPX and non-SSPX commentaries on the NO about how it is a danger to the faith. That much is convincing. \n\nBut I‚Äôm concerned about a few things related to this. And have a few questions and don‚Äôt really feel comfortable contacting the SSPX priests in my area. They‚Äôre just a small sample size. \n\nDo all SSPX priests say, for a catholic who understands that the NO is dangerous to the faith due to its deficiencies, and scandals, etc, that one should never attend the NO mass?\n\nWhat about attending a very reverently celebrated NO mass when none other is available? Would every SSPX priest discourage people from attending this? What if it‚Äôs more convenient? As an example, there‚Äôs a NO mass near the office where they celebrate mass at noon or right at the end of work that doesn‚Äôt cause scandal.\n\nWhat about someone who accepts that it‚Äôs dangerous, but prepares themselves, accepts the danger, and practice devotion, spiritual reading, and associating with faithful orthodox friends while still going to the NO?\n\nWhat about confession with a NO priest? Spiritual guidance and direction? Deliverance and exorcism? Do all SSPX priests counsel people to never seek assistance from a NO priest under any circumstances?\n\nIntellectually, the argument that the NO is dangerous, allows for or promotes heresy, is tightly connected to revolution in the Church that deserves to be publicly opposed and rejected, all of that makes sense intellectually. But then saying that one should never attend the NO under any circumstances leads to consequences that don‚Äôt quite make sense‚Ä¶\n\nNot all NO Catholics are faithless and impious. Many never attend the TLM but hold onto orthodoxy and practice their faith seriously. Shouldn‚Äôt traditional Catholics be encouraged to associate with them?\n\nJust because a priest has SSPX next to his name doesn‚Äôt mean he is virtuous, wise, and can help you spiritually. Many times NO priests will go the extra mile to give spiritual guidance and help in many ways. Should these NO priests just be avoided altogether? What do you do if you have SSPX priests in your area that you don‚Äôt really trust to help you in spiritual matters, but you know NO priests that you do trust? It doesn‚Äôt make sense to avoid them just because you only go to the TLM and take a traditional stance on the issues in the Church.\n\nWould all SSPX priests tell you to never seek spiritual and moral help from NO priests?\n\nI guess I‚Äôm less concerned about the intellectual reasonings behind why the NO mass should be rejected, and more concerned about the practical consequences of saying one should never attend the NO. My current thought is that if a faithful Catholic seeking the traditions and goes to the TLM exclusively and occasionally goes to the NO mass to pray and receive communion, there is nothing wrong with that. Or if one attends the TLM but goes to NO priests for counsel and sacraments, there is nothing wrong with that. But then these positions I hold seem to be contrary to what the SSPX says about never attending the NO.\n\nThoughts? Comments? Answers?\n\nThanks for reading through my thoughts in this long post. \n\n",

On the outside perspective, which is ours (the faithful), no big difference can be found between a reverent NO Mass in latin and a TLM. However, when the \"Brief Critical Exam of the NO\" was released, the NO they analysed was a reverent NO in latin, and they still saw major problems with it. Sure, the problems aren't easy to spot for us, but if you pay attention to the \"script\" and compare it to the TLM's, you'll notice the sense of sacrifice of Christ (which is the definition of Mass) is completely missing; rather, it's a vague sense of communal meal that's left. So if a priest celebrates it with a traditional mind (meaning believing the Mass is the sacrifice of Christ), it doesn't change the fact the rite is in itself uncatholic.\n\nWhen Luther created the lutheran \"Mass\", he made sure to only change very superficial looking aspects, hoping explicitly (he says it in his books) to change people's faith without them even realizing. That's a historical exampleof why us the faithful should be extremely prudent about rite.\n\nFinally, regarding the NO faithful and faith, sadly they often have a non catholic belief regarding many beliefs relating to the Christ the King dogma; most of them believe in Free Speech, in tolerance of false religions, and that false religions aren't essentially evil and that people can be saved through them, etc., and regarding the Mass many of them relativize the Catholic meaning of Mass etc., so we can see the consequences of the NO."

        "body": "Archbishop Lefebvre says one can attend the Novus Ordo:\n\n‚ÄúIf one does not have the choice and if the priest celebrating Mass according to the Novus Ordo is faithful and worthy, one should not abstain from going to Mass.‚Äù -Archbishop Lefebvre, 1970\n\nThis is one of many quotes where Archbishop Lefebvre recommends attending the Novus Ordo if one is unable to attend the Traditional Latin Mass. This is a position that can be endorsed. A person might believe the Traditional Latin Mass is the best expression of the Catholic faith, but if unable to attend the Traditional Latin Mass, one should seek out an orthodox Novus Ordo Mass.\n\n‚ÄúMake every effort to have the Mass of St. Pius V, but if it is impossible to find one within forty kilometers and if there is a pious priest who says the New Mass in as traditional a way as possible, it is good for you to assist at it to fulfill your Sunday obligation.\" -Archbishop Lefebvre, 1972\n\nOnce again, Archbishop Lefebvre supports the opinion that the Novus Ordo can and should be attended if no Traditional Latin Mass is available. It is important to note that currently the SSPX holds a different view. Let‚Äôs take a look.\n\nThe Society as of 2024:\n\n-The Novus Ordo is intrinsically offensive to God.\n\n-The Novus Ordo is intrinsically sinful to attend.\n\n-The Novus Ordo does not fulfill one‚Äôs Sunday obligation.\n\nArchbishop Lefebvre, 1972:\n\n-There are times when the Novus Ordo Mass can be ‚Äúgood for you to assist at‚Äù.\n\n-The Novus Ordo is not intrinsically sinful to attend.\n\n-The Novus Ordo can fulfill one‚Äôs Sunday obligation.\n¬† ¬†¬†\nThe Society writes this discrepancy off by explaining that Archbishop Lefebvre wanted to be cautious about condemning the Novus Ordo too soon. However, even five years later, he still was open to the possibility of assisting at the Novus Ordo:\n\n‚ÄúTo avoid conforming to the evolution slowly taking place in the minds of priests, we must avoid‚ÄîI could almost say completely‚Äîassisting at the New Mass.\" -Archbishop Lefebvre, 1977\n\nHere we run into the first issue of the SSPX. They hold that the Novus Ordo is both objectively and intrinsically offensive to God. This must imply that a simple reading of the text of the Novus Ordo Mass is sufficient to definitively determine that it is a sacrilegious rite and offensive to God. However, this view does not seem to match the historical evidence. If a simple reading of the text is enough to determine its intrinsic sinfulness, why did it take Archbishop Lefebvre at least eight years to figure it out? Additionally, here Archbishop Lefebvre states he believes that the Novus Ordo can be celebrated with a totally Catholic faith.\n\n‚Äú[The Mass] is ambivalent and ambiguous because one priest can say it with a totally Catholic faith in the sacrifice, etc., and another can say it with a different intention, because the words he pronounces and the gestures he makes no longer contradict [other intentions].\"\n-Archbishop Lefebvre, 1975\n\nEarly on, Archbishop Lefebvre saw the Novus Ordo as both dangerous and ambiguous, but never as intrinsically and objectively evil, as the SSPX does today. Here is a quote from Marcel Lefebvre: A Biography that reinforces his thoughts:\n\n‚ÄúWhen Archbishop Lefebvre was absent on a Sunday, the seminarians would go and assist at Mass together at the Bernadine convent of La Maigrauge where an old monk celebrated the New Mass in Latin.‚Äù\n\nIf the Novus Ordo can be good enough for his seminarians, surely it can be good enough for us! Archbishop Lefebvre emphasized that well-trained, orthodox priests, can provide a Novus Ordo Mass that one can, and at times should, assist at. This is a striking departure from the current language of the SSPX today.\nHowever, even if the current SSPX doesn‚Äôt agree with Archbishop Lefebvre, I do. The Traditional Latin Mass is beautiful, reverent, and full of catechesis. It should be attended when possible. However, if no Traditional Latin Mass is available, one should seek out a reverent and orthodox Novus Ordo Mass to attend. By Archbishop Lefebvre‚Äôs own¬†metric, this should be done if there is no Traditional Latin Mass within a mere 40 kilometers (25 miles)! That is not a very far drive. Archbishop Lefebvre says that a person should attend a orthodox Novus Ordo Mass if no Traditional Latin Mass is available. He says that this ‚Äúobjectively, inherently, and intrinsically offensive‚Äù Mass can, and sometimes should, be attended. There is an obvious disconnect, a break, between these words of Lefebvre and the current position of the SSPX. This should be looked at and considered seriously. Is the Novus Ordo inherently offensive to God or not? If Archbishop Lefebvre has said the Novus Ordo can be good to attend and can fulfill one‚Äôs Sunday obligation, why does the SSPX now endorse the exact opposite belief? And if the Novus Ordo is objectively, inherently, and intrinsically offensive, how could this change?"

I'll pray for both of us in my rosary tonight that we can have those gifts. \n\nI feel a bit out of my comfort zone, but I'll do my best to answer the questions you posed. \n\nI don't know of any SSPX priests who would openly and publicly encourage someone to attend the NO mass, even if done reverently. That being said, I imagine that there are situations where they would hold that it is actually the best thing to do. For example, as far as I know there are no Latin Masses in Peru, so imagine this: A Peruvian family somehow stumbles across the teachings of the SSPX and decides their positions are the true ones. However, there are zero Latin Masses in their country. To simplify, they have two options: find a reverent and sacred NO mass they can attend, or never receive any more sacraments (I know they could move or something, but for this hypothetical let's just imagine that it isn't an option for whatever reason). I firmly believe that the best option for them would be to find a really good NO mass to attend and start going, to let their children receive the graces from valid sacraments, and do their best to adhere to the true  orthodox faith. Similarly, if someone in prison desires to become Catholic and the only recourse to the faith they have is a NO priest. What should they do? They should seek out that NO priest and receive the sacraments. These are both extreme examples, but I would like to believe that if posed with these scenarios, that a SSPX priest would agree with these outcomes. However, I don't know if any SSPX priests would come out and say this publicly, but perhaps privately. \n\nHow can we explain the shift from allowing the NO Mass at certain times to it now being offensive to God? I don't have an answer. But, here is my theory. As time went on Lefebvre did  become harsher toward the NO Mass, and I can hardly blame him. There were more and more abuses going on. More and more reports of priests doing crazy things. Sacrilege. Blasphemy. Irreverence galore. And in this age before the internet, the lay people were left to their own devices. Largely, they didn't have access to church documents, and they couldn't look online to see if their priest was the right thing or not. They were completely left on their own, unless they just happened to have books to help them look up orthodoxy. Did their priest slyly teach heresy from the pulpit, how were they to know? In this type of circumstance, yeah, swearing off all NO Masses might be the best thing to do. Lefebvre saw the way the tide was flowing, the Masses were getting worse, and who knows when it would stop. His position, and the position of the SSPX,  as a safeguard became hardened against the NO Mass. \n\n However, now we are in a different scenario. The NO Masses hit rock bottom, and then slowly began to improve. More and more there are priests working hard to make their NO Masses solemn and reverent. They, once again, are celebrating the Mass in a way that brings back the reverence and sacredness of the sacrament. They, once again, are celebrating the Mass in a way that Lefebvre would probably let his seminarians attend if they didn't have any other options. But the SSPX has this problem: in rejecting the NO Mass when it was at its worst, they don't have a way to open it back up now that it is better. Their stance is locked against the NO mass. There is no one who can change it. They're stuck against the NO even as more and more reverent and sacred NO Masses happen around them. \n\nSo, in short. The NO mass was tolerable for Lefebvre at the start. He felt people could go, especially if they didn't have other options. As things became worse he hardened against the NO. This stance was later codified by the SSPX. Now the NO masses are improving, but the SSPX doesn't have a way to soften their stance. They are stuck in their stance and seem to be holding on to it even though there are reverent and pious NO masses that people ought to be able to attend if they don't have other options."

On the \"right\" of the Commons, or later on in the Missal you'll have the Propers for the weekday Masses. If there's no Mass for a feast day that's called a Ferial and the priest will usually say the Mass from the preceding Sunday, though sometimes he'll say a votive Mass instead (and typically the priest will announce what votive Mass he is saying).\n\nEvery Mass starts off the same with the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar (part of the Commons), then after that the priest will say the Introit (part of the Propers), so if you're following along you flip to the Introit for the Mass of the day, then you'll flip back to the Commons for the Kyrie and Gloria, then flip to the Propers for the Collect, Epistle, and Gradual/Alleluia/Tract, then flip to the Commons for the Mundae Cor Meum prayer, flip to the Propers for the Gospel, etc etc.\n\nTypically most Missals will have more directions and page numbers \"teaching\" you how to use the Missal for the First Sunday of Advent, so if you find that in your Missal it should help you figure it out.\n\nIt would be swell if someone made a video explaining how to use the Missal, I think a lot of things would end up being improved because we would all benefit from it.\n\nAlso if you go [this website](https://www.divinumofficium.com/cgi-bin/missa/missa.pl) it will have everything you need on one webpage so you don't need to worry about knowing where to find things.

Specifically, on the conflict between traditionalists (like Messrs. Buckley and Davies) who loved the Tridentine Mass, and reformers (like Monsignor Champlin) who support the Novus Ordo mandated by Vatican II. JC: \"You liked the old worship because the 'I' was able to pray, and you weren't kind of impinged by the priest or other people? That kind of notion? ...\" WFB: \"It gave me a sense that the priest was there as a mediator between me and God, whereas it seems to me that the existing approach tends to be sort of crowd-oriented.\" JC: \"I think that's the key thing right there.... Before Vatican II, when I was ordained in '56, the Mass was very much a mystery. I was a priest with my back to the people, in Latin, there was silence in the congregation.... The Council, then, going back to the best traditions of the early Church, said it's both 'I' and 'we' together. It's a vertical worship, yes, but it's also a horizontal worship.\"*"

I know why Jackleclash used it, and we would agree on various things. Certainly, Jackleclash and I would agree on things such as if the sspx were to discontinue then its an obvious sign it wasn't from God. But what I'm pointing out is the first part of the quote and saying that it's a problem. Just because it is continuing does not mean it's from God. But one who supports the sspx would see that quote, see that the sspx is continuing, and therefore logically conclude that the sspx is from God. But what I'm simply pointing out is that isn't sufficient because that same logic can apply to other positions. I could be a Baptist pastor and tell someone in my congregation the same thing about our church. That would alleviate their worries but it doesn't mean that it's correct. It's either from God or it isn't, if it's from God then it's good for your soul, if it isn't then it's not good for your soul, simply remaining in existence doesnt make it of God. However, you have to know whether or not it's from God and can't gamble on waiting around to see if it ends or not. What if the sspx ended tomorrow, what about all of the souls who followed the sspx that passed before seeing that it ended? Many people believe the sspx to be the best means of salvation, so much to where if a family member of theirs is still Catholic but no longer goes to and supports the sspx then they're seen as putting their soul in danger. So the root question is what if the sspx position is wrong but still continuing? Is it still of God, is it still ok for one to follow their position?"

I did not know at first that you were discussing from the point of view of one who thinks that there is no reason for the SSPX to exist, and that it would be best if the SSPX simply folded itself into the FSSP (with their probable suppression shortly thereafter). I suppose you would have also counseled Archbishop Lefebrve to stop being recalcitrant and just go ahead and celebrate the Novus Ordo Mass The SSPX does not agree with your point of view. Neither do I.\n\nStill, let me add that excommunications were never \"imposed\" on the bishops. Rather, the motu proprio Ecclesia Dei stated that they were (automatically) excommunicated as provided for in canon law. The distinction is important, because whether or not they were excommunicated depends not on a single sentence in canon law, but rather the whole of canon law. I am not trying to debate whether or not they were excommunicated here, just pointing out that there is a difference between your assumption about what happened and what the motu proprio actually said. Even at the time there were professors of canon law who stated that the motu proprio was wrong and that the SSPX bishops were not actually excommunicated. Of course there were also those who took the opposite position.\n\nIn any case, the position of Archbishop Lefebvre and of the SSPX is that there is a crisis in the Church and that it is necessary for the SSPX to continue maintaining the traditional doctrine of the Church and the traditional formation of priests until the crisis is over, and that this necessity requires the SSPX to continue to ordain priests and thus also to consecrate bishops."

It was a consequence that they \"imposed\" upon themselves and yet it was rescinded by the pope. The 2 remaining bishops are not currently excommunicate, I'd imagine that they would like to keep it that way. \n\nAs to your first point, that isn't a correct characterization of my point of view regarding the Society. My opinion right now is that they don't seem to have any will towards any type of licit status inside the church, while still claiming that they are \"in communion\" with the church. They seem quite comfortable on the sidelines, safely out of the fray. At least in my experience around the US, they operate their chapels and \"missions\" absent any contact or concern regarding the local Ordinary of the Diocese. This was not so much the case before. \n\nThere are very practical concerns at this point that make the question of any sort of arrangement with Rome seem self defeating. If they did end up with some agreement, probably half their supporters would leave, probably with a significant number of priests. (Look what happened when it was just mentioned as a possibility, especially  Bp Williamson, who spun that situation way out of control) Conversely, if thy were to consecrate new bishops, they would be faced with the opposite problem. A bunch of people and priests would leave, like last time, it would just be other group. I've discussed this with an SSPX priest and this was his take. (So one man's opinion, but a very well reasoned one) So the practical reality of any substantial erosion of support could be catastrophic to the society just from the standpoint of maintaining the amount of real estate that they own. I really feel that they have boxed themselves into something of a corner. They're smart guys, but it's going to take a pretty nuanced maneuvering to get through it and manage the blowback. \n\nAnd one last point, since this thread is getting hijacked, I suppose in some part by me, so I'll stop after this. I really am surprised by all of the sentimentality on display over Bp Williamson by supporters of the SSPX. The guy really went off the rails, he spent his last decade in public opposition to the SSPX, headed up the Resistance group, consecrated like 7 (?) illicit bishops... he was an incredibly intelligent, and charismatic man, who held much influence over many souls- but he had a major problem with pride and discretion and consequently fostered much confusion and distress among well meaning and trusting people. I hope he can rest in peace, but he lead a public life in unrepentant public scandal."

The difference between the NO and the TLM is essentially a question of personal preference, the NO is a fertile rite as well (but in private most priests say that the NO is at least not as good as the TLM, and has some issues with it). The situation is not grave enough to use the right of necessity to get extraordinary jurisdiction. \n\n  \nOther differences: sedes have many bishops, the consecrate them when they think it useful.

Here are the 2 arguments in favor of that:\n- getting communion from a priest symbolizes being in communion with him; officially, the FSSP accepts V2 and the NO. Therefore, getting communion would mean being in communion with those\n- going to an FSSP parish means getting FSSP friends, FSSP sermons, FSSP parish catechism, etc. : it's impossible not to be influenced, \"a man is nothing but the sum of his friends\".\n\n\nSo my conclusion was that the first argument doesn't necessarily work (since the priest in this FSSP parish doesn't formally accept Vatican 2), but the 2nd definitely does. However, the 2nd also depends on some factors: if you're really well formed, going to the FSSP in rare and exceptional occasions won't hurt too much. I personally became more and more strongly convinced of the SSPX's position since I started being in touch with the FSSP. But I also came to the conclusion that going there \"full time\" as regular parish.\n\n\nSo I understand your reasons, it does sound very tempting, sometimes the SSPX seems to be a refuge for social outcasts, but so was early christianity, doctrine goes before social life even if it is sometimes a big sacrifice. Once you start going to a parish, if you appreciate the community, you might be tempted to go there more and more.\nDon't forget the FSSP is allowed to be installed everywhere the SSPX is: this shows that the Vatican's goal is to drain the SSPX into the FSSP. Let's not fall in the trap liberal bishops we keep complaining about! Most of the FSSP parishioners/priests are very good people, but sadly their official positions aren't good, and the don't have bishops like the SSPX does that could save tradition. An SSPX parish is small and boring? Let's make it thriving ourselves!"

Camille Perl):\n\n‚ÄúIn the strict sense you may fulfill your Sunday obligation by attending a Mass celebrated by a priest of the Society of Saint Pius X.‚Äù\n\nPontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei (2003):\n\n\"The Masses celebrated by the priests of the Society of Saint Pius X are valid but illicit, that is, contrary to canon law... One does fulfill the Sunday obligation by assisting at a Mass celebrated by a priest of the Society of Saint Pius X.\"\n\n\nPontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei (2015):\n\n\"The faithful who attend Mass at an SSPX chapel out of devotion to the Tridentine Mass fulfill their Sunday obligation. However, they must not do so with the intention of separating themselves from communion with the Holy See or the local bishop.\"\n\nHere are even more authoritative quotes to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Church‚Äôs position on attending SSPX Masses:\n\nPontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei (July 18, 1994):\n\n\"We have already stated that the Masses celebrated by the priests of the Society of Saint Pius X are valid, though illicit. As far as fulfilling the Sunday obligation is concerned, we have affirmed that this is satisfied under certain conditions, that is, if the intention is not to separate oneself from the communion of the Church.\"\n\nPontifical Council for Legislative Texts (2000):\n\n‚ÄúA Catholic may fulfill the obligation to assist at Mass on Sundays and holy days of obligation at a Mass celebrated by a priest of the Society of Saint Pius X, but this is not encouraged if it involves an attitude of rebellion against the Church.‚Äù\n\nCardinal Ratzinger (Later Pope Benedict XVI, 2000):\n\n\"The SSPX priests administer sacraments validly but illicitly. Catholics should be encouraged to attend Masses in full communion with the Church whenever possible. However, one fulfills the obligation if attending SSPX Masses without intending to reject the magisterium.\"\n\nPontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei (May 23, 2008):\n\n\"Participation in these Masses does not constitute a sin, nor does it entail a schismatic act. However, it is necessary to distinguish between the valid celebration of the Eucharist and the question of legitimate celebration. The latter refers to the recognition of the authority of the Pope and the communion with him.\"\n\nPontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei (September 27, 2002):\n\n‚ÄúThe Society of St. Pius X remains in an irregular canonical situation. Faithful who attend these Masses fulfill their obligation, but the Church strongly recommends that they attend Masses in full communion with the Church, especially to avoid any risk of fostering division.‚Äù\n\nPope Francis (Misericordia et Misera, 2016):\n\n‚ÄúI have decided to extend the faculty to hear confessions validly to priests of the Society of St. Pius X beyond the Year of Mercy, trusting that in the near future solutions may be found to recover full communion with the priests and superiors of the Society.‚Äù\nThough not directly addressing Sunday obligation, this acknowledges the validity of SSPX sacraments."

In my experience, supporters tend to view this as some vindication, or even a sort of ‚Äôgotcha‚Äô, towards the pope. Like he had to admit that they‚Äôd been right all along. I remember first hearing about this and reflecting that it was very rarely, if at all mentioned by the priests in a public way, since obviously it would infer an admission that prior to this SSPX priests didn‚Äôt have the authority to hear confessions (because they didn‚Äôt). As a lifelong supporter of the SSPX until fairly recently, their generally casual attitude towards legitimate local authority (I‚Äôm in the US) has always seemed at odds with their rigid stance on the authority of their own hierarchy. And instead of acknowledging this, what should be described as a mercy from the Holy See to the benefit of the faithful like myself who have been receiving the sacrament from SSPX priests my whole life, it seemed pretty self serving not to be outwardly thankful for what truly amounts to a benevolent gesture towards the faithful supporters of the SSPX who have been receiving absolution in good faith for decades."

All the Sacraments provided by the SSPX priests and Bishops are valid, real, Catholic Sacraments. If you are confirmed by an SSPX Bishop then you have received a valid Confirmation from a Catholic Bishop.\n\nThe people you have met who refuse to attend the Novus Ordo probably won't attend because that Mass is inferior to the Mass which came before it, which is what the priests of the SSPX say. Many books could, and have been, written on why but for your purposes the exact details probably aren't that important or relevant. That is simply the reason why. The position of the SSPX is that the Novus Ordo Sacraments are valid but basically inferior to the older ones. Baptism for example is particularly inferior to the older rite."

Have you tried asking them? You're clearly quite new to all of this, if you just ask them, or ask the SSPX priest, and say you genuinely just don't have a clue why, then they will probably tell you why. It isn't because they are somehow not Catholic. People attending the SSPX Mass are attending the same Mass that their parents and grandparents going back for centuries have, it's practically the same Mass as the 6th century Mass with minimal differences.\n\nThe answers you hear vary from person to person but most generally agree that the old Mass is superior, and that there are to one degree or another deficiencies in the new Mass which are not present in the old Mass. I mean think of the Sacrament of marriage: the most abuse, hateful marriage and the most loving, holy marriage may both be valid marriages, but you know which one of them you would prefer to have. The same is true of the new and old Mass, both are valid but one is far better than the other."

It is dangerous to your faith. Realistically what would happen is you would either be angry/depressed every time by irreverence/priests saying stuff that isn't Catholic teaching, or you would gradually assimilate.\n\nEspecially since you're a new Catholic: you won't have the formation to be able to tell what's right and what's wrong so you'll just drink it in.\n\nThere are many Church-approved circumstances for when the Sunday obligation ceases to bind.\n\nMy copy of \"Moral Theology\" by Fr. Heribert Jone (a pre-Vatican II moral theology manual for priests) says this:\n\n\"III. Excuses from assisting at Mass. Any moderately grave reason suffices to excuse one from assistance at Holy Mass, such as considerable hardship or corporal or spiritual harm either to oneself or another.\"\n\nIf you regularly attend the Novus Ordo, there is a very good chance you will suffer spiritual harm. Therefore, you are not obligated to go.\n\nIf the Institute of the Good Shepherd Mass is an hour or less away, I would do that. A lot of people at my SSPX church travel 45 minutes-1 hour to be there. If not every Sunday, at least 1-2x per month, as another person said.\n\nI would also try to re-arrange your class schedule to make it more compatible with the Archdiocesan Latin Mass. You should be able to choose other classes at different times, do some classes online, etc.\n\nIf you need to, you could watch a live-streamed Latin Mass on YouTube on Sunday, but that isn't a long-term solution.\n\nWith the baptism and formation thing, I would figure out a game plan with the priest. They are correct about the emergency baptism thing, that's more for if there's imminent danger of death. You should be able to read a traditional catechism on your own and meet with them periodically 1-on-1 to ask questions.\n\nIn the meantime, our SSPX priest had my wife and I read this catechism for our marriage prep and it was very good:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Brief-Catechism-Adults-Complete-Handbook/dp/0895554925/ref=sr\\_1\\_1?crid=37RT7NAMENI5B&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Z-nqkxsY5nrOOybVhOV19YBGBb1yKNcgdW0MjhfDqMQjBR-U09wv4Z\\_zrVW0Yii1\\_PIemb4gTE93eist\\_L5bTNweTU1L-pebBEcEQyvzh\\_VYio1-YO\\_CaPUany1NjFU0BX8Tld91w8Pehu8vByTioQ.HDh\\_FJCrVqGBJ1Bgyd7aUJA\\_Cqh0eDkMtal8lGp3E4I&dib\\_tag=se&keywords=cogan+catechism&qid=1736612193&sprefix=cogan+catechism%2Caps%2C124&sr=8-1](https://www.amazon.com/Brief-Catechism-Adults-Complete-Handbook/dp/0895554925/ref=sr_1_1?crid=37RT7NAMENI5B&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Z-nqkxsY5nrOOybVhOV19YBGBb1yKNcgdW0MjhfDqMQjBR-U09wv4Z_zrVW0Yii1_PIemb4gTE93eist_L5bTNweTU1L-pebBEcEQyvzh_VYio1-YO_CaPUany1NjFU0BX8Tld91w8Pehu8vByTioQ.HDh_FJCrVqGBJ1Bgyd7aUJA_Cqh0eDkMtal8lGp3E4I&dib_tag=se&keywords=cogan+catechism&qid=1736612193&sprefix=cogan+catechism%2Caps%2C124&sr=8-1)\n\nIf you have specific questions, you can also ask [mastercatechism.com](http://mastercatechism.com)"

The declaraction was never signed, but the Resistance suspects Fellay to still wanting to sign it, so they stay out of the SSPX and accused Fellay of being a modernist who wants the Society to basically be a new FSSP / ICKSP. The talks between Rome and the SSPX came to a stop after Williamsons famous interview on the holocaust.\n\nWilliamson was told to stop his \"Eleison Comments\" newsletter, which he didn't, and Fellay kicked him out because of \"disobedience\" (but really, it was about the direction of the SSPX: uniting with Rome on a practical, but not dogmatic level and risking liberalism or staying separate from Rome and getting accused of schism).\n\nSince Williamson was then the only bishop in the world to not bow to Zionism (like both Ratzinger and Fellay), he went ahead and consecrated four new bishops, citing the same jurisdiction of emergency as Lefevbre in 1988. Fellay condemned this as a schismatic act, but now has the problem that the Vatican doesn't want to approve new bishops for them either without the SSPX agreeing to Vatican II.\n\nI personally side with the Resistance because I read the 2012 letters, but I still go to the SSPX for sacraments and there are also priests in the SSPX who occasionally keep contact to Williamson. \n\nThe Resistance priests are notably more conservative than the SSPX, but they aren't sedevacantists.

The interview happened in 2010, the expulsion was in 2012, over two years later, when the media frenzy had already died down.

That is where the jurisdiction comes from, it doesn't come from the Pope, it comes from the fact that 99% of Catholics sign off on heresy. So, in other words, Fellays current direction to reconcile is against the original purpose of the SSPX.\n\nAnyway, I guess the people who understand why Williamson did what he did (he esp. feared Zionism infiltrating the Society), understand why the Society now is \"nicer\" to Rome (who are also under Zionist control). Certainly, the fact that Maximilian Krah, an Israeli-allied \"Christian\" was in charge of the finances at the time, also didn't help. Williamson did nothing wrong, neither morally (anyone should be able to speak about the holocaust) nor ecclesiastically (he was right to resist Fellays course because it would undermine the mission of the Society and its jurisdiction)."

The SSPX upholds the teachings of the Church that the salvation of souls is the highest law, to the point that its leaders have disobeyed/displeased the Pope rather than contravene that highest law. This was most apparent in 1988 when the SSPX consecrated 4 Bishops so as to ensure the continuation of its mission of forming priests in the traditional methods as a way ensuring the access of the faithful to the sacraments confected in the traditional ways (Archbishop Lefebrve, realized that Rome was simply stalling and way for him to die, so he made the difficult decision of proceeding with the consecrations in light of the extraordinary circumstances). To put it simply, the SSPX would rather offend the men who happen to be installed in the Vatican rather than offend God. Obviously this is a strange and tenuous circumstance (imagine your mother tells you to do something that you think is wrong, it‚Äôs not right for a child to be put in that position but ultimately the child must follow their conscience even if it offends the parent), and several priests of the SSPX thought that the episcopal consecrations were a bridge too far (in spite of the fact that the SSPX had almost always been disobeying the men in the Vatican in one way or another) and left the SSPX and went to Rome asking for a way to celebrate the traditional liturgy while maintaining good relations with the Vatican. The Vatican formed a commission to oversee these priests called the Ecclesia Dei Commission, there‚Äôs a few difference organizations underneath this commission (FSSP and ICKSP are the two largest and most well known), but ultimately the groups were allowed to exist on the condition that they accept everything the Vatican has promulgated, including everything promulgated at the pastoral council of Vatican 2, explicitly as a way of getting the faithful who are ‚Äúattached‚Äù to the traditional liturgy to become more open to the innovations of Vatican 2. Individual priests belonging to the groups might express criticisms of Vatican 2, but these are purely personal opinions (and certainly not values as they are unwilling to suffer for them), when push comes to shove the Ecclesia Dei priests cannot criticize the Council or the Vatican and have formally accepted the changes in the Church. A person who claims to be a Christian and who does everything that a Christian does, and only puts just one little grain of incense on the altar of a false god cannot be a Christian; so it is with these Ecclesia Dei priests.¬†\n\nThey want to have their cake and eat it too: they have an emotional attachment to the liturgy and are willing to sacrifice principles (accepting the innovations of V2) in order to not feel like they are breaking with the men who happen to be in positions of power in the Vatican at the present time.¬†\n\nUltimately only time will reveal the error of their ways, and it could very well take centuries.¬†"

Sure, I've sat through some bad liturgies at SSPX masses, but I've also sat through a 2 hour pre-1955 Palm Sunday liturgy at a Diocesan parish which was \"performed\" for the 2 old ladies in the parish who go to everything. There is never any social occasions around the ED/Diocesan masses. It's all rather business like. Come in, do mass, leave.

I was about 17 or 18 before I even found myself to the Novus Ordo, and older still before I first attended an SSPX Mass.\n\nThe first time that I went to an SSPX Mass in my area everyone was extremely warm, welcoming and kind to me. They noticed that I was new and they invited me to pray the Rosary with them after Mass and come get food with them later on. They even paid for my tab which was beyond generous. The priest as well approached me in the parish hall when everyone was having tea after Mass to introduce himself, very kind French man, and welcome me to the parish. They basically treated me like I was their family despite most of them having only just met me. If you compare that to how welcoming the local diocesan Latin Mass is, by comparison they basically treat new people like contagious lepers.\n\nI really can't speak on what SSPX women think of going out with men who weren't raised in an SSPX community since I'm not a woman nor was I raised in an SSPX community. All I can say is that it has been my observation that they are probably going to be more interested in what your behaviour, virtue and beliefs are than necessarily whether you were raised in the Novus Ordo. If I had a daughter raised in a Latin Mass community I would certainly be cautious about her seeing someone who had literally just shown up 5 minutes ago. But you don't stay a new stranger forever. Keep absorbing the traditional faith and you will no longer be an outsider.\n\nOne thing I will say is that while yes it's good that people pair up and get married, it is my experience that people who come across like they're simply hunting for a girlfriend aren't seen too favourably and that type of behaviour tends to be looked down upon. Just be a normal person, don't be too intense trying to hunt down a girlfriend, and everything will probably be fine. Arseholes are universal, just because someone attends an SSPX Mass doesn't make them immune from sin. You will always encounter people in life who aren't as nice to you as they should be.

We, as Catholics, are quite used to strangers dropping by. Perhaps they are travelling. We don't want to push them if they're just passing through. There is also the curiosity factor with the SSPX (and to an extent, any Traditional Catholic church) - let's be honest, this is a very different style of worship to what most Christians are used to. We don't know if a newcomer is testing the water or has been attending the Traditional Mass elsewhere for decades.\nSo take your time.\n\nNow, I'll address the more sensitive part of the question.\n\nIs it possible that you will be accepted for a relationship with an existing member of the community?\n\nOf course. If new blood doesn't come in, these Traditional families will die out. Already, certainly in the relatively small country I live in, there is a lot of intermixing between a small set of Traditional Catholic families. ***BUT*** - be absolutely sure that this is not your intention.\n\nAs someone who has been part of Roman Catholic Traditionalism for coming on for 11 years now, I can sniff out someone who is \"hunting\" from miles away. There are a certain *type* of man, who is attracted to the innocence of a woman and the trappings of her traditionalism with nefarious intentions. This can lead to a lot of pain for a lot of people.\n\nIf the priest has warned someone about you, then someone else will have spoken to them about your behaviour. Be incredibly mindful of your actions and how they can be viewed. If they have spoken out, then they are concerned about the intentions towards someone. I would have a good think about what you might have done. It might be worth having a chat with the priest about how to approach this in a manner that will not lead to anyone getting hurt.\n\nAge gap relationships are scarily common in the traditional scene and they often bring other issues with them. The priest is likely acting with the best intentions of both you and the woman involved, looking to steer away from a possible scandal but also trying to make sure that nobody gets hurt.\n\nIf you are new to the community, I would recommend **NOT** dating anyone until you are stable within the community. You still have a lot of distance to cover to fully understand how the Traditional scene works. I'm only just figuring it out, and I've been part of it for +10 years, and even then, I still don't fully feel like I know what's going on!"

So emergency baptism (which can also be done by a lay person), emergency absolution and emergency last rites.\n\nI don't actually know what the penalty is for a priest who continues to minister after they have been laicised.

This was the first time I've had a dubious absolution since converting, so even if I should have corrected Father, I was a little shell shocked and nervous to do so, especially as he wasn't my regular confessor. I'm going to my local SSPX chapel for Mass tomorrow as usual, but I don't know whether I need to re-confess to make up for today. I suppose it would be safe to do so anyway and just mention the circumstances.

Where we now live is an eight hour round trip to the closest SSPX Mass. That is not reasonable except for a couple of times a year. Our pastor reminded us that SSPX has not rejected the Pope and it is not in schism. He said, go to the most reverent local parish you can find so you can receive the Eucharist. Regularly. He advised us to look on masstimes.com to find a parish with daily Masses and more than once a week Confession and Holy Hour (some, we‚Äôve discovered, only have Confession by appointment). We have taken his advice. Six months ago, we traveled out of state to an SSPX chapel for Sunday Mass. we went over the day before and stayed in a hotel overnight. Even so, it was a long day driving home, after driving the day before.  We did not feel comfortable eating at a restaurant after Mass. We could not eat the hotel ‚Äúfree‚Äù breakfast because there was not enough time between it and Mass.  \n\nIf we accept the validity of the current Pope, even if we are not comfortable and have concerns about the NO and all the changes it has brought to the church, then, we should be able to go take Communion (on the tongue) at a NO parish when we can‚Äôt go to an SSPX mission. I advise folks in similar situations to look for ‚Äúreverent Catholic Masses‚Äù which tend to be hybrid with a lot of Latin, more silence, more traditional, and beautiful. There are none of those close to us either, but a couple are 2.5 hours away, which is more doable. Not for membership and full participation, but definitely more often than once or twice a year. \n\nWe feel we were led by God Almighty to be where we are now. We have continued faith there is a reason for it and it will reveal itself its own season."

Short form: It doesn't express the Catholic faith, not even ad orientem and in Latin. All \"offensive\" prayers that can't be prayed by Protestants were taken out and on top it was written by six Protestants. An attendance at a NO is basically a denial of the Catholic faith and a support of an ecumenist \"all faiths are okay\" one. He who doesn't profess the faith by staying silent will not enter heaven.\n\nSecond, the NO is basically indistinguishable from an Anglican or Lutheran Mass, which, in some cases, have valid Eucharists. But we don't go there because we're Catholic, not Anglican. The NO priests all have to sign that \"Vatican II is okay\", which is a bold lie. We are not supposed to be \"in communion\" with them, support them or pray with them. Even if we are \"excommunicated\" by them, it does nothing for us, because you cannot mock God with legalese. It is only \"Catholic\" in name, but not in faith, it expresses nothing that is uniquely Catholic.\n\n[According to Fr. Gregory Hesse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1OlGrTU7s), a renowned canon lawyer, the rite of the NO is not the \"development\" of the Latin Rite, it's such a substantial change that it's effectively a new, schismatic, rite. It leads people away from the faith, because what you practice becomes what you believe, not the other way around.\n\n> The Holy Eucharist at a Novus Ordo Mass is somehow not the Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Our Lord?\n\nThe SSPX doesn't deny that the Eucharist is valid, but that doesn't mean that you can automatically go there. A valid Eucharist doesn't make a valid Catholic Mass. Orthodox have valid Eucharists too, we don't go there. \n\n> How is that even remotely possible and how have the gates of hell not prevailed?\n\nMate, please read up on the difference between material and formal heresy. The current pope says that all religions lead to heaven yet we still say that he's the pope, even though that statement is objectively heretical. As long as the pope does not himself believe or know that he is acting agains the Catholic Church, it means he is in material error, but not formally outside the Church (doesn't mean we support what he's doing). The popes since VII did a massive oopsie. A massive one, but that doesn't mean he's not pope anymore, but also doesn't mean we can blindly follow him. \n\nI don't know why someone is on the SSPX subreddit but doesn't know the basics about the SSPX stance on Vatican II. Going to Mass is not a commandment, sanctifying the Sunday is. If you cannot go to an SSPX mass it would be better to not go to Mass at all rather than going to a Mass with people who accept the false teachings of VII but celebrate a valid Mass (ICKSP, FSSP, some Eastern Churches too) or be in communion with people who both in doctrine and practice deny the Catholic faith (NO). Because the goal of the Sacrifice of the Mass is to be pleasing to God and such a sacrifice, while \"valid\", cannot be pleasing to God."

I've been to many NO parishes in my Diocese and the neighboring Archdiocese and have seen many people (yes, including young people and families) attend. There's also a large and active young adult group in my Diocese. In my time in the sspx I've seen maybe 6 or so adult conversions but have seen many Baptisms listed in various bulletins for the Easter Vigil. We also can't assume that VII or the NO is the reason for a fall in Faith when 1) Africa and Asia are growing despite lacking the TLM and 2) the sexual revolution and rise of atheism in the West. It's not just Catholicism that saw a decrease in the West, protestants had a decline as well, they wouldn't even have been impacted by VII or the NO.\n\n\nI skimmed through the article you linked, interesting how this is noted: \"These 62 reasons have been written by the priests of Campos (Brazil) before they dangerously accepted a canonical recognition by the conciliar Church\" so do these priests even still believe they originally wrote? (not gonna lie, \"conciliar Church\" is just flat out cringe. The \"conciliar Church\" is still the Catholic Church) it reminds me of Fr. Udressy, the former sspx district superior of Germany who left the sspx last year for reconciliation with the Church.\n\n\n\n\nThe whole 6 protestants argument is a false belief, one that I held myself. The 6 protestants were obsevers and had no part in the composition of the New Missal. In fact Max Thurian converted in and became a priest. Here are some quotes from him prior to his conversion: ‚ÄúI have no difficulty in affirming that in the new Order of the Mass, nothing has been changed with respect to traditional Catholic doctrine concerning the Eucharistic Sacrifice.‚Äù and¬†\"Recently a Protestant liturgical commission was given the task of revising the prayers of the Last Supper. It was proposed that they adopt the second Catholic Eucharistic Prayer (inspired by Saint Hippolytus). That proposition was rejected, because the commission considered that the doctrine implied in that prayer did not correspond to the actual common faith of Protestants. . . .the invocation of the Spirit on the bread and wine presupposed Transubstantiation.\" Here's another quote related to the protestant liturgical commission¬†from Lutheran scholar Jean Pleyber in 1976: \"As to the matter in question, I have often assisted at Masses celebrated according to the new canon, and each Sunday I have viewed a televised Mass. I have never seen evidence that such Masses deny the sacrificial character of the Eucharist. And when I hear said and when I read that ‚Äúthey have fabricated a Protestant Mass,‚Äù I know only too well that this is not true and that such persons are wide of the mark. I have even asked the priest in my village to forward the new liturgical texts to me, and I am convinced upon reading them that nothing has changed in Catholic Eucharistic doctrine. I believe it is useful to say that the Catholics who speak of a ‚ÄúProtestantized Mass‚Äù are quite ignorant of Protestantism and perhaps of a great deal of Catholicism.\"\n\n\n\n\"We are not supposed to be \"in communion\" with them, support them or pray with them.\" My guy, that is literally schismatic according to the second part of the canonical definition of schism. You do this again later when talking about the fssp, institute, other Eastern Churches and accusing the NO of denying the Catholic Faith. Its baffling when i hear defenses that the sspx isnt schismatic yet this (as I was already aware of) is the sspx position. It's this kind of attitude that I once held that made me nervous about attending my local diocesan TLM when I left the sspx a little over a year ago and it's absolutely ridiculous.\n\n\nYou either a) have never attended a Novus Ordo Mass b) have never paid attention when attending one or c) have unfortunately been exposed to an actual problematic parish (to which I have the utmost sympathy for you if that's the case) the Catholic Faith is literally expressed in the Mass, the True Presence is literally expressed in the Mass, \"Sacrifice\", \"Offering\", and \"Victim\" are explicitly said in the Mass, in fact the GIRM use Sacrifice/Sacrificial 19 times in the introduction alone, when receiving Communion you literally affirm that you believe in the True Presence (protestants accuse us of idol worship for that btw) Fr. Hesse is problematic, I wouldn't be looking towards him for advice on the subject. I find it funny you say that it leads people away from the Faith when ex sspx attendees have a newfound love and devotion to the Faith after leaving the sspx (and other groups) and primarily attend the NO. Meanwhile, the sspx (and other groups) lead people out of the structure of the Church that Christ established and receive illicit and in cases of marriage and confession (except for the sspx after the year of mercy though permissions are needed for marriages) invalid sacraments. But will appeal a false sense of supplied jurisdiction.\n\n\nThe sspx position is that the Holy Eucharist is doubtful in the NO. And yes, Eastern Orthodox do have valid sacraments but they're illicit and not in Union with the Church. Same with the sspx, resistance, and other groups. And before you \"the sspx says the Pope's name in the Canon\" 1)Old Catholic groups do as well 2) the sspx priests are suspended from public ministry (besides confession and with permission marriages) they do not have the necessary permissions and supplied jurisdiction does not cover this.\n\n\nSo quick correction the actual quote is \"...every religion is a way to arrive at God\", this is still certainly problematic and the Holy Father should clarify what he meant (i have a feeling i know what he was trying to imply but that's a whole different debate) Regardless there's a major difference between Pope Francis making an off the cuff remark and his authentic Magisterium. There's a difference between his off the cuff remark and an ecumenical council that your are required to assent through Faith as a Catholic and a Liturgy that was promulgated by the Church.\n\n\nDude, I'm well aware of the sspx's position on Vatican II, I was a staunch supporter of the sspx for nearly 20 years. Note, I hate using that online since it just sounds like progressives who say \"I went to Catholic school\" and since you have no idea who i am (or maybe you do, I know a lot of people in the sspx) you can't really verify that. Regardless, I know the sspx's beliefs, I used to share them myself. Certainly, sanctifying Sundays/Holy Days is the Commandment to which the Church declares that to do so is to attend Mass. Otherwise, I could just take the Dimond Brothers position and stay home all the time. The Sacrifice being pleasing to God is also one that's in Communion with the Church, not ones that are parallel altars against the Union of the Church such as the sspx, resistance, old Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, sspv, cmri, and all the other independent groups who have taken it upon themselves to act as the authority of the Church and treat the Church as losing the Faith as every schismatic group has done throughout history¬†"

Also, there is a global doctrinal collapse, self-considered Catholics believe less and less in Catholic dogmas both in the West and in the rest of the world. \n\nThe fact that in the West protestantism declined in the same time as Catholicism is not proof that there is no crisis; the main thing trads accused Vatican 2 was to protestantize Catholicism, so it makes sense they'd follow the same trends. Islam is thriving here, and Muslims (in French opinion polls at least) are more and more believing in what islam teaches. Also, as Hillaire belloc explained, heresy is often about adapting to the current ideas, so Catholicism lost his purpose here. There are also many negative trends that were exacerbated after Vatican 2.\n\nregarding the \"62 reasons\", I prefer the brief critical exam, actual doctrinal arguments. \n\nAccusing someone of not having attended the NO because they disagree with you is very easy. From your arguments I could say you haven't talked to any SSPX priest about that specific issue. \"Sacrifice\" is used indeed, but in ambiguous terms that don't imply that this is the factual renewal of the sacrifice of Christ. Let's continue being specific, real presence is not enough (even Lutheran believe in it), transubstantiation is the full needed doctrine. \n\nregarding schism, you need evidence to claim that. However, the right of necessity authorizes priests to celebrate Mass without jurisdictions, so to settle this debate one needs to settle the previous one about the NO.  \n\nAlso you're pointing at the many different trad groups, but there is way more doctrinal divergence within the NO (from FSSP to gay German priests): the sad truth is, their religious relativism makes them not care about that.\n\nFinally the example of Fr. Udressy you gave... You seem to have information that hasn't been released because he hasn't given his reason (most papers say exactly that), my guess is that there isn't any doctrinal reason. But we lose a priest, we gain a bishop... Bishop Strickland has just released a communiqu√© praising archbishop Lefebvre... in the footsteps of bishop Huonder. Personal examples are nothing, my SSPX parish is thriving, the NO parishes in my area are catastrophic, but I'm not generalizing. \n\nSorry if I sound a little bitter (maybe I should spend less time arguing on internet and touch grass haha), I'll compensate by doing my evening praying in you intention!"

        "body": "First, I live in Germany. That should answer your question as to why I hate the NO so much. The NO is nothing but a leftist-green political festival at this point, where women lecture about how oppressed they are and how African \"refugees\" are the new Lazarus and we have to take them all in. Occasionally you have fun liturgical abuse like chicken dance mass in Passau. This is the NO here. You cannot convince me that this is \"Catholic\" just because of the label above the door. Yes, there are \"better\" ones, I do not care to hunt. This is the average NO here.\n\nOur bishops are so leftist, they're technically even formally in schism after they signed the \"K√∂nigsteiner declaration\" where they flat-out rejected the \"no\" on contraception by Paul VI (and also continued the German Synodal Way, even after multiple \"no\"s by Francis, where they discuss fun topics such as female priests, the definition of a woman and whether priests are even necessary). But, according to you, they still have the label \"Catholic\" and that's all that matters for heaven, yes? The bad evil SSPX is in schism for continuing the TLM, but Mrs. \"extraordinary minister\" handing out communion in the hand will go to heaven because she is \"in communion\" with the \"proper\" Church. \n\n> And when I hear said and when I read that ‚Äúthey have fabricated a Protestant Mass,‚Äù I know only too well that this is not true and that such persons are wide of the mark.\n\nI was Protestant myself. [Here's a random Lutheran Mass](https://youtu.be/xEWgi4K-Oq8?t=2699) and it's virtually indistinguishable from a regular NO (they're even more reverent since they line up properly at a communion rail which many NOs fail at).\n\n> I believe it is useful to say that the Catholics who speak of a ‚ÄúProtestantized Mass‚Äù are quite ignorant of Protestantism and perhaps of a great deal of Catholicism.\"\n\nThere is no real difference between the NO and any Lutheran Mass. Protestants also speak of \"sacrifice\", but they mean something different. They mean \"Sacrifice\" as in \"remembering Christs sacrifice on the Cross\".\n\n> My guy, that is literally schismatic according to the second part of the canonical definition of schism. \n\nSchism from the modernist Church yes, but who schismed? To schism means to cut oneself off from tradition, now: is ecumenism and religious freedom Catholic teaching because it was promulgated by the \"Catholic\" church? I'll cite Dignitatis humanae ¬ß4: \"Religious communities (note: especially including Islam) also have the right not to be hindered, either by legal measures or by administrative action on the part of government, in the selection, training, appointment, and transferral of their own ministers, in communicating with religious authorities and communities abroad, in erecting buildings for religious purposes, and in the acquisition and use of suitable funds or properties.\" - effectively this means, Islam now has the \"right\" to spread their false faith. I ask you: Would you sign this? Is this Catholic teaching, \"validly\" promulgated? If you answer \"yes\", I need a serious, serious explanation, if \"no\", then why do you attend a Mass held by a non-Catholic priest?\n\nWe are in schism from the conciliar Church, yes, because they no longer teach the Catholic faith, but an ecumenist one. The conciliar Church is only Catholic in that they have a valid hierarchy, but they are all in material, even if not formal, heresy. Some priests even agree with the SSPX but don't have the guts to leave (they're just cowards). Especially under Francis, diocesan priests are a lot more SSPX-phile than you are.\n\nI do not want to be in communion with modernists, because in order to get into heaven, the label \"Catholic\" matters less than the faith \"Catholic\". THEY schismed from Tradition at Vatican II, they do not hold the eternal Catholic faith (or else please explain how the freedom to error is suddenly Catholic teaching). They are the ones who introduced never-before held doctrine on religious liberty, with their bastardized Mass (the NO is merely an expression of that faith, that all faiths are welcome and equal), the \"development of doctrine\" (doctrine does not develop as truth does not change), etc. Francis' remark was not \"off the cuff\", he even tripled down on it. It was an expression of that new faith. In any other earlier century he would've been threatened to be killed for being a heretic if he wasn't pope.\n\n> The 6 protestants were obsevers and had no part in the composition of the New Missal. \n\nThey were officially only \"observers\" at the council, yes, but later actively assisted Bugnini and there were a lot of \"talks\" at the dinner tables after the meetings. Paul VI wanted the NO to be easy for Protestants to accept, and invited them to help. To say \"they did nothing\" is disingenuous - then why were they invited in the first place?\n\n> the Catholic Faith is literally expressed in the Mass, you literally affirm that you believe in the True Presence\n\n(a) No it isn't, only [30% of NO attendees believe in the Real Presence while 99% of TLM attendees do](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/08/05/transubstantiation-eucharist-u-s-catholics/) and (b) I've been to quite a few NOs and don't remember hearing the word sacrifice (I did hear \"offering of gifts\" like in Protestant circles). The NO is so good at teaching transsubstantiation, that 70% lost the faith. Amazing.\n\n> In fact the GIRM use Sacrifice/Sacrificial 19 times in the introduction alone\n\nGive me a NO that actually follows the GIRM like Paul VI intended. I'll wait. I, for one, have never even heard the word \"sacrifice\" in an NO. It's usually just a bunch of songs (literally in any order, there's no common structure to it like in the Latin Mass), then the priest does an \"offering of gifts\", the consecration and hands out the communion. I've been to NOs. I won't return.\n\n> I find it funny you say that it leads people away from the Faith when ex sspx attendees have a newfound love and devotion to the Faith after leaving the sspx (and other groups) and primarily attend the NO.\n\nYes, it's called Stockholm syndrome. There are a few people like that and it's mostly redditors for some reason. Haven't met someone IRL like that. My guess is that they have to somehow gaslight themselves that the NO is perfectly fine and there's no problem with Vatican II, so then they double down on being a rabid popesplainer and St. Francis of Rome can do no wrong. They do feel that something is wrong, but they want to be right so they can ignore the problem of global apostasy and try to convince themselves that there's no problem with Vatican II and it can somehow be explained away. Also happens to \"Anglo-Catholics\" a lot who desperately try to reconcile Anglicanism and Catholicism. It's the same reason why hypocrites commit sins but then are driven towards doing more and more good works: because they want to silence their conscience with good works, which tells them that something is wrong, yet they somehow have to justify ignoring it.\n\n> (except for the sspx after the year of mercy though permissions are needed for marriages) invalid sacraments\n\nWhile it doesn't matter (the SSPX has jurisdiction just by the fact that 99% of \"Catholics\" signed off on ecumenism and therefore lost the faith, the SSPX has to exist or else the Catholic Faith is lost), the year of mercy got extended indefinitely and hasn't been retracted so far. The SSPX has full jurisdiction from Pope Francis himself and even a popesplainer like you would have to admit that.\n\n> Fr. Hesse is problematic, I wouldn't be looking towards him for advice on the subject. \n\nAh yes, just call someone \"problematic\", without addressing his arguments. Classic argumentation.\n\n> But will appeal a false sense of supplied jurisdiction.\n\nSo, you would rather go to a church that teaches ecumenism, but has \"proper jurisdiction\", than go to a Church that does not teach it because it somehow doesn't have jurisdiction? Which one will get people into heaven?\n\n> It's this kind of attitude that I once held that made me nervous about attending my local diocesan TLM when I left the sspx a little over a year ago and it's absolutely ridiculous.\n\nSorry to see you leave but I don't get why it's ridiculous to call the NO schismatic? Do you also support going to the newly approved Mayan rite just because the pope said it's okay now (it was \"validly promulgated\" after all)?\n\n> an ecumenical council that your are required to assent\n\nNo, an \"ecumenical council\" is only believed to be infallible if it: defines doctrine, excommunicates someone or anathematizes. VII didn't do any of that, it's perfectly fine to not accept it. As said by John XXIII himself, it was merely an \"aggiornamento\", an \"updating\" of the faith to the modern world. You are thouroughly confused on what the term \"ecumenical council\" actually means."

You can't have multiple religions all claiming to be the one true religion (especially since most of them, the Catholic Church included, explicitly say that other religions are false, so not everyone can be right simultaneously). \n* **Holy**: the entire point of religion is worshipping God, so you absolutely must judge a religion based on how well it does this (so mega churches with their ridiculous over the top theatrical \"worship\" displays are out, also religions that incorporate degenerate activities as part of their \"worship\" - this was more of a problem with paganism).\n* **Catholic**: this word means universal. God should be worshipped by all people, so any religion that is designed for one demographic to the exclusion of others (eg a specific race or nationality, or a religion mainly for extroverts) can't be the one true religion as everyone should be able to belong to it. \n* **Apostolic**: by now you will probably have concluded that a religion based on the Abrahamic traditions is the one true religion, and the Roman Catholic Church is the only religion that is based on the Old Testament and then has an unbroken chain of authority going all the way back to its founding by Jesus Christ Himself who fulfilled the prophecies of the Old Testament. Most religions these days are started by random people with no divine mandate that can be found in other texts. Jesus passed on his authority to Peter, the first Pope, who later passed it on to Linus, and so on. The Eastern Orthodox Church used to meet all of the above criteria, but in 1054 they formally split off from Rome and refuse to this day to acknowledge the authority of the Pope, which disqualifies them as being the One True Religion. \n\nFrom there it's pretty simply to realize that while the Roman Catholic Church is the One True Church, there's been a Crisis in the Church since the 60's if not earlier, and the SSPX is the only group within the RCC to acknowledge this openly and publicly and is basically \"frozen in time\" until competent discussion of the huge changes can happen. The men who happen to be in power in the Church refuse to allow any questioning of these huge changes, so until that happens, the SSPX is left in the awkward, lonely, position of  remaining faithful to the traditions of the Church and the highest law of the Church which is the salvation of souls. All the other \"trad\" groups (FSSP, ICK, trad Diocesan) implicitly declare by their actions that obedience to the current administration is more important than the salvation of souls."

Being unbaptized only makes it harder since I don‚Äôt have the grace of baptism yet to strengthen me. I‚Äôm waiting until Easter to be baptized, but until then, it feels like every effort I make isn‚Äôt enough. Even walking outside brings temptations I can‚Äôt fully escape. I‚Äôve tried cutting out anything that causes me to fall, but no matter how much I limit, the temptations still come. I‚Äôm lost and don‚Äôt know what to do anymore; it feels like I‚Äôm fighting a battle I‚Äôm destined to lose.",

I would also recommend that you make an active effort to pursue more wholesome activities. For me, it's studying that helps a lot. My confessor recommended that I read about the church history as it's something I find very interesting and it really helped. For some people it's exercise, others it's music. Do what works for you - if you don't know, ask for it to be shown to you.\n\nTemptations will continue to arise but if you have a strategy to manage them and you trust in God and ask for the grace to overcome them, you will manage to do it.

We imagine that we participate in this High Mass an autumn Sunday in the middle of the 1400s. It is the people of the village that participates in clothes typical to that time and we have to the best of our abilities tried to reconstruct how a Mass was carried out in the* [*Diocese of Link√∂ping at that time. Gotland at that time was part of the Diocese of Link√∂ping*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Link%C3%B6ping)*.*\n\nThere are two versions of this footage on YouTube.

That obligation to receive once per year is also within reason and subject to the possibility that there is a just and reasonable reason why someone cannot fulfil it.\n\nIf someone is unable to receive on the tongue in their parish then there is no one forcing them to receive on the hand. They only *need* to receive the Eucharist once per year, and it's within the obligation's rules that as they can't do so in their home parish they can reasonably receive on the tongue elsewhere to fulfil the obligation.\n\nAs for a seminarian example you give, why is that person in a Novus Ordo diocesan seminary to begin with? If someone doesn't want to receive Communion on the hand why in the world are they going through a seminary which will turn them into priests who the Bishop will force to give Communion on the hand to parishioners at every Mass? Even if someone in a Novus Ordo diocesan seminary makes it through without having to receive Communion on the hand they will still be expected to distribute it on the hand. There isn't a single diocese in the world, other than maybe Campos in Brazil which is a completely exceptional and special circumstance, where a diocesan priest won't be forced to give Communion on the hand. In such a hypothetical scenario of that seminarian it would make me question what in the world they are doing in that seminary to begin with, and why they didn't just go to a traditional seminary.\n\nI am aware of a small subset of delusional \"traditionalists\" who believe in \"infiltrating\" Novus Ordo seminaries and playing some sort of \"long game\" to get ordained then somehow at some point in the future turn around and if they become a Bishop implement good policies. Complete fantasy. You're there getting a theology lecture from the Novus Ordo trousers wearing cryptolesbian \"nun\" and other sorts of poison blasted at you 24/7 and at the end you will just be relegated to some arctic wasteland in Alaska when they find out that you aren't 150% on board with modernism. Yeah good luck trying to \"subvert the subverters\". Many men who would have made good priests completely throw away and waste their lives in this folly. Even though trad seminaries are always full their foolishness still deprives us of more needed priests."

        "body": "Receiving Holy Communion in the hand is not sinful when done with the proper dispositions, especially if it is the only option provided by authority. Historically, this practice dates back to the early Church. St. Cyril of Jerusalem (4th century) instructed the faithful to \"make your left hand a throne for the right, as for that which is to receive a King,\" emphasizing profound reverence in this practice. He also spoke of receiving both the Body and Blood of Christ, indicating that communion under both species was common in some early communities.\n\n\nThe Eastern Catholic Churches have preserved the practice of receiving Holy Communion in both species for centuries, often using intinction (dipping the consecrated Host into the Precious Blood). While their practices differ slightly from those in the Latin Rite, they illustrate the diversity of legitimate traditions within the Church.\n\n\nIn the modern context, the Church has affirmed that receiving in the hand is permissible if done reverently, as outlined in Memoriale Domini and subsequent permissions from the Holy See. These documents stress that reverence for the Eucharist is paramount, regardless of the manner of reception.\n\n\nFor a seminarian or parishioner unable to receive on the tongue, their obedience and interior reverence take precedence. The moral responsibility lies with those enforcing the limitation, as long as the recipient approaches with the proper faith and devotion. The Catechism (CCC 1415) reminds us that the state of grace and proper disposition are what truly prepare us for receiving Christ.\n\n\nThus, while the traditional reception on the tongue has significant value, receiving in the hand can also reflect a deep respect for the Eucharist when approached thoughtfully. It is not sinful when no alternative is available, provided one's heart is properly disposed."

I look at my diocese (I live in the countryside). We have dozens of diocesan priests and no traditional priests. We have a population that, for the most part, doesn't even know what TLM is.

Yes, you may be scandalized by some expressions of modernism in your own Diocese, but it seems like you could persevere in the good fight regardless. The call is to love your flock as Christ loves the Church.\n\nMake no mistake, I love that more young men are entering traditional seminaries. However, there is somewhat of a bubble effect - people who love the TLM join seminaries that love the TLM to minister to Catholics who love the TLM. There are many NO Catholics who have simply been raised in modernism and do not know any better. These people need to be evangelized by priests who are willing to enter imperfect Dioceses and fight the good fight, bringing reverent liturgy to people to help them *desire* tradition and the TLM.\n\nI'm not surprised that you have received comments not favorable to this endeavor, but those are the kind of opinions you'll find in some traditional corners of the internet. A very good priest friend of mine kept his head down in seminary, says the TLM privately when he is assigned to NO-only parishes - but through his preaching he is inspiring a generation of young men and women to desire tradition. If he had gone to a far-off traditional seminary, these parishioners might not have had such truths preached to them.\n\nPerhaps you will be ostracized. Perhaps you will be isolated, impaired in your studies, assigned to a parish in the middle of nowhere once you are ordained. The life of a priest is not meant to be a comfy one, it is meant to be a life of sacrifice - an *Alter Chrisus*. Many desire traditional seminaries because they would suffer in their ordinary Diocesan formation, but suffering is a core component of the Christian life. It can be fuel for the fire of your interior life, giving you inner strength to persevere through the tribulations that you will inevitably experience.\n\nIf you have time, I would check out [this interview](https://youtu.be/o8ubCSJya-A?si=tp1ozosWIGnyXIgr) with Dr. Ed Feser.

I just wanted to drive home that it's not your money (a little or a lot) saving people, only Gods grace. Plus \"doing charity\" alone is not the end goal of charity (it can reduce suffering, but not eternal).\n\nJesus prefers the 2 cents of the widow to the riches of surplus of a rich man. A $2 pamphlet that saves one soul can get more reward in heaven than rich man that founds an entire university, little money with Gods grace is more effective than a lot of money without grace. On the other hand, he tells us to *be wise and use our money wisely* (parable of the ten talents). Jesus also wanted the rich young man to trust him and immediately follow him (to make him a disciple), however, this was a direct command from God (which is not your case).\n\nI would not see it as a \"either or\", you can give some money away right now, some along the way and some later. So for me, I'll rent out the houses as long as possible, but not invest the generated money into stocks, but use it immediately for tasks at hand. That way I'm never really rich (which is tempting me to laziness), can save souls now AND later and have a security in case of unpredictable emergencies (let's say 20 years down the line the SSPX goes woke / modernist and I'll have to leave them behind, something like that). I guess that is a decent tradeoff on \"invest now vs invest along the way vs invest on my deathbed\".\n\nPriests in the SSPX do not take vows of poverty (as they're more or less missionary priests) and monks in the medieval era funded themselves with renting their property, as true poverty proved to be hindering to the actual goal of monks: saving souls and focusing on prayer. **Poverty is not a virtue, but a removal of a spiritual obstacle**, i.e. \"not being attached to your money\" is the first goal. But being rich is good for having your hands free for other stuff, it's not bad in itself. So take my example: it's basically the same way as monks funded themselves all throughout the ages.\n\n> I personally sought information about entering traditional seminaries and, at least for the reality where I live, being accepted into these seminaries is extremely unlikely, since they are not accepting \"strangers\", but only those boys who grew up in the traditional rite, were altar servers there and so on.\n\nHm yeah, I'm not familiar with FSSP / IBP, etc. I didn't expect them to be this cliquey. I cannot recommend them obviously because as long as they're in the \"official\" Church, they're \"fake traditional\": sure, they have nice Masses, but have to obey a more-or-less modernist pope in order to keep the buildings and joining them doesn't do much for the long game (see the [FSSP Chartres pilgrimage being threatened to be shut down](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/260875/vatican-could-reportedly-restrict-latin-mass-for-chartres-pilgrimage-french-media-claims)).\n\n> As for modernism, I think I can receive the teachings there with a presumption of heterodoxy and form myself in parallel.\n\nMaybe in a FSSP / ICKSP seminary, but not in a diocesan. Lots of people tell themselves that, lots of people fail. The \"bishops\" are pure leftists or silent weaklings, from what I've heard. I'd really warn you about this: it's more or less putting yourself into an occasion of sin (or in this case, occasion of modernism), you will probably get infected by it (even the SSPX isn't completely free), even if you don't: as soon as you attempt anything trad within a modernist seminary, you'll be not ordained, kicked out or transferred to the diocese of Antarctica and celebrate the Latin Mass for penguins (kidding, but you get the point). \n\n> Yes, I will need to be discreet on some topics in the diocesan seminary, but I think it can be opportunities for growth in humility. \n\nWell at least here in Germany, the \"bishops\", if they even deserve that title, are pure heretics. Can't speak for Brazil, but I highly doubt you'll learn anything about the actual Catholic faith in a diocesan seminary. Above all you need to save your own soul, so that's why I wouldn't want you to join a Novus Ordo seminary.\n\nThe best case outcome in a diocesan seminary (if you even make it to ordination without being discovered as an undercover trad and manage to keep your faith) is being someone like Fr. Nix, a \"diocesan hermit\", i.e. monk-ish travel priest with a decent bishop that allows him to celebrate the TLM. Most people I've spoken to say, in Rome nothing will change until the boomers have died out (somewhere between 2040 and 2060, when the Novus Ordo will die from natural causes).\n\n> Who knows, by then we won't have Latin Masses in my diocese.\n\nExactly (also why I consider them \"controlled opposition\", because while they do celebrate nice Masses, they do little to get Rome back on track in the long run and without the SSPX existing, they'd be shut down by the pope in a few years time). They basically exist to distract (parishioners and seminarians) from the SSPX and so it's not helping in the long game."

        "body": "> By yeah you mean that is indeed very unlikely for me to be accepted in the SSPX seminary?\n\nThe SSPX constantly says they need more priests, not less. So the SSPX seminaries do have free slots, at least here in Germany. If you're not getting into an FSSP seminary, it's at least worth a try to apply at the SSPX. However, they obviously would like to keep their priests after ordination, because the SSPX funds the seminary and they have an anti-modernist oath, which would probably prevent you from switching later to a diocesan seminary. And they relocate their priests often, but maybe you can talk about starting a mission in your diocese (and not have to worry about getting your TLM restricted).\n\n>Do you personally know guys who tried to do this and became corrupted?\n\nI admit that I know too few diocesan priests to make a judgment, but an SSPX priest told me this: the Church is a hierarchy and there are cases where you have to obey. So, operating within a bad hierarchy to \"subvert it from the inside\" will fail because the people at the top very well know what's going on and are not well-meaning. Traditionally, all attempted subversions were knifed down by the pope, but in this case it sadly happened that they struck the head. So now it is better to take a step aside and let the corrupt hierarchy collapse. Maybe they will let you continue if you're not dangerous enough. But once you start causing trouble (or in the case of your priest, save \"too many\" souls), they will hinder you, censor you, etc. So your goal to save souls is limited from the start. Plus, you're getting a worse formation than at any trad seminary and have to learn to shut up about the scandals in the Church, have to popesplain things, etc.\n\nThe biggest problem is what you're NOT learning, e.g. you're not learning that certain things are sins, like immodest clothing for example (it's just the first thing I notice in NO masses). So, how do you expect to give souls good advice if you haven't learned to distinguish good from bad? And if you dare to speak up, you'll be censored. You're not learning to be steadfast and have a backbone, you're learning to be a company man. Padre Pio was holy, but not always well liked, but he cared more about saving his flock than being popular. If I was you, I'd be trying to get the best education possible because after ordination you're going to be too busy to teach yourself on the side. Also, your means of communication in seminary will likely be restricted, so the \"learning on the side\" will likely fail.\n\n> Despite everything, I see good priests ordained by the diocese (maybe something like 10% of the total?)\n\nYes, but remember: the first soul you need to save is your own and it can be easily lost: if you advise badly, you as the priest will be responsible for the mistakes of your flock. So, if you go into a seminary that has a 90% modernist priests, how high will the chance be that you won't get infected, spread modernism and go to hell for it? I think the advice from your spiritual director is naive.\n\n> Are you of the opinion that it would be in any case morally wrong for me to celebrate in the NO?\n\nYes because of what the NO expresses, how it got introduced, the new theology that went alongside it, the prayers that were cut to please Protestants, Orthodox and Jews, etc. etc., even if celebrated reverently. I know these priests are \"good guys\", maybe they are popular (popularity doesn't mean anything, Protestantism is also popular) and certainly well-meaning, but the opposite of good is well-meaning and nice. Bishop Williamson once called it \"the heresy of niceness\" (versus the virtue of steadfastness). I could never do this, I'd see myself as a supporter of the biggest Church crisis today, I mean, why did these souls get lost in the first place: because of the introduction of the NO. It was a disaster and the more I learn about it, the more scandalous it gets, how the NO was pushed from a small group of Rhine theologians, against the will of most bishops at first (they thought Bugnini was nuts, but then later went along because they weren't well organized and didn't expect such massive changes). I just want the NO to die out naturally so that ultimately the TLM can take over and save more souls because one displays the actual Catholic faith and the other is a Lutheran-lite service and is misrepresenting the identity of the Church.\n\nTLDR: see if you can get into the SSPX seminary in Argentinia, from what I've heard the SSPX is not full. Lastly: it's better to NOT be a priest than to be a bad one. Better to be on a waiting list for a trad seminary and having to wait a couple years, than to risk being infected and spreading modernism. Ask them to open a mission near you (the SSPX only opens missions where it knows that Catholics are). If you are popular, the money will come automatically, but you won't have to put your own soul at risk. \n\nI can only advise you this far, you're going to have to make the choice yourself. God bless you."

My brother was sent to South Africa, he could have been useful in my family/city but I think having a right formation matters the most.\n\nI see your point. On the other hand, I see some other relevant factors.\n\nOn the part of my personal salvation , well, of course it would be possible anywhere in the world. But I have always been very close to my family and I don't see that this relationship hinders my path to God, but rather that it gives me strength and support. Besides, going to another country (due to the seminary) is a considerable change, considering how well I will adapt to the local culture and so on. And, being ordained a traditional priest, I think these changes of location will be quite frequent (something I am not very inclined towards naturally). \n\nMost importantly, in the part of saving others, I am thinking, don't we also need traditional young men entering the diocesan clergy? Otherwise, the situation in the dioceses will only get worse. I live in the countryside and I don't see the possibility of a Traditional Mass institute being established here in the near future. What we have are the diocesan and religious priests, all NO. \n\nCould it be that God is asking me to \"fight the good fight\" here where I grew up and be an instrument of salvation for these people, even without studies as good as I would get in a traditional seminary?"

On the other hand, things may change in a decade.\n\nWith that in mind, do you think it would be worth entering the diocesan seminary?\n\nI wonder, don't we also need traditional young men entering the diocesan clergy to \"fight the good fight\"?

The fact that most seminarians were raised in tradition isn't because the SSPX only accepts them, it's simply because traditional families are more prone to create children having a traditional vocation !\n\n\nRegarding donors, I think it's the SSPX who finds them, but the seminarians can help. For example, my friend who is in seminary doesn't have a rich family so SSPX donors are paying for him.\n\n\nRegarding being vaccinated against modernism, I don't think it's impossible you go through staying traditional, but I think it's not going to replace a good traditional formation you'd receive in a traditional seminary; also, the SSPX's position is against the New Mass, I personally agree with that, and you'd have to learn to celebrate the New Mass if you went to a NO seminary, I think this is actually the main issue.\n\n\nRegarding being discreet and left in peace, I think it depends what you're willing to say and how \"tolerant\" the seminary is, so it's difficult to give a definite answer; no matter what I don't think it's a very healthy way to spend a few years of formation.\n\n\nSeminary in my opinion is more than a mandatory step to get ordained, it's a complete life formation that should deeply influence the seminarian to make a good priest, so I don't think it's possible to go through it with a mindest going against the modernist teachings in NO seminary, without lacking what a priest would have after going to a trad seminary.\n\n\nRegarding your relationship with your family, the SSPX is not making people cut the bridges with their families! However it's certain that a priest, no matter where he's sent, will have a new state duty, and his parishioners will have to go above his own family. It's really easy to say for me as a layman who isn't entering the seminary, but we have to sacrifice everything for the purity of the faith we transmit to others!\n\n\nI have a grand-uncle who entered the NO seminary with a traditional mindest, but now he's like the average NO priest I know.\nThere is a difference between being conservative and being traditional; being traditional is only accepting what doesn't contradict Tradition, meaning only the TLM and disagree with Vatican II on some issue, and those 2 things are definitely not publically believed in the diocese. Believing that, you won't ever be made bishop or more, meaning you'll always be dependent on people you disagree with on key doctrinal issues. Nobody is useless where he is, but the NO priests who become traditional are alone and persecuted, and man's not made to be alone, priests should have superiors and colleagues having the same traditional faith as them in order to spiritually survive.\n\n\nI have example of good diocesan priests who are doing good where they are, but no example of diocesan priests who are fully traditional and who didn't end up having to give up some of their traditional beliefs.\n\n\nAnyway, I'm sorry of what I say can sound easy to say, harsh and judgmental, this is not my intention, I just think you having the vocation is great, and I wouldn't want a fellow traditionalist ending up stuck without tradition!"

    "selftext": "Objectively, the religious state is superior to the secular state and better assures us of our sanctification and eternal salvation.\n\nSaint Thomas and Saint Alphonsus, for example, seem to make it quite clear that a long deliberation is not necessary to evaluate the decision to enter the religious state, since this desire comes from God and is advice that Christ himself gave.\n\nHowever, when we move from theory to practice, the situation does not seem so simple to me.\n\nI understand that the motivation for entering religious life, as it is currently structured, is to seek one's own sanctification through the observance of a rule/constitution (which theoretically would lead the individual to holiness more effectively than if he remained in the world) in a community/under the authority of a superior, conditions that would serve to encourage/oblige the observance of the rule/constitution (and, therefore, the pursuit of perfection).\n\nHowever, from what I can see, this is only true as long as the religious house lives by the observance of the rule/constitution. But what if the religious house becomes corrupt/the superior is deposed and another wicked one is put in his place/the religion is suppressed by the hierarchy of the Church or by the civil authorities?\n\nFor example, even Saint Benedict entered a monastery where, later, they tried to poison him. He left. But, nowadays, a monk in that situation, without money, without communication with the outside world, without support from family and friends, without being able to act against the obedience of the superior and with a vow of stability to that community, he could not simply leave.\n\nIn a certain sense, it seems similar to married life. One can do everything to choose the right spouse, but there will always be a risk.\n\nMore specifically, the emergence of this doubt is linked to my vocational discernment.\n\nI identify to a certain extent with the monastic life, the silence, the contemplation, the retreat and the withdrawal from the world.\n\nHowever, when considering specific monasteries, I came across different realities.\n\nThere would be the option of a monastery with a stricter observance, but probably I would go hungry and sleepy, conditions that I know wear me down and take away my desire to even pray. In addition, for example, to not having access to the internet, which for me is a great tool in studying.\n\nOn the other hand, there would be another with a more relaxed observance (where I would also be ordained a priest), but the abbot is not as holy or competent as I taught, the community is old, not fervorous and selection criteria for entry are lax.\n\nSometimes it seems that I do not really want to follow the Rule of St. Benedict to the letter (as it would be in the monastery with the strictest observance), having the impression of \"I know what works best for me\". In a less strict monastery, I would be able to exercise my spiritual life as I wish, but precisely because it is more lax, I am concerned about what the future of the observance of the rule / constitutions in this monastery will be.\n\nIn addition, I have a certain amount of wealth that I have built up over the years that I have worked (I intended to get married) and sometimes the risk of giving it up through a vow of poverty does not seem to be worth the expected return. Likewise, I do not know if this is a question of disordered attachment, but I have always been very close to my family, and distancing myself from them in a stricter enclosure also seems to me to be a risk, in case, as mentioned, the monastery in question becomes corrupt.\n\nFor these reasons, I have wondered whether the secular priesthood might not be a safer path, one in which I could serve God without the risk of vows of obedience, poverty, and stability (which, theoretically, would serve to free me from worldly concerns to turn more easily to God, but, in practice, they can actually cause more concerns).\n\nIs this way of thinking correct?",

So I posted a couple of days ago about friends and relationships but I need some help understanding if my current motives are personnaly emotional or spiritual based for others.\n\nNow I moved north earlier this year as I was in a bad place and had to leave. When I moved North, I lived with my sister who needed someone to help around the house with her 2 young nephews whilst her husband was away. I did a mixture of practical things whilst also being a firmer hand and father like figure when needed. For the first time in a long time, my nephews made me feel life nothing in life mattered more than the moment spent with them, essentially a feeling of wanting a family and something more.\n\nWhilst up there, I also had a break from a full time job and helped my brother in law's parents doing up their new house (I'm a tradie) in which over the 6 months gave it my best whilst making enough money to survive on. I heard that I was the answer to a novena to Saint Joseph for all I did for them and what they wanted done.\n\nNot only that, I made good friends with my brother in laws sister and her family in which I also helped them and they were very grateful for the help I gave the whole family and how much it meant.\n\nNow I moved south shortly after as I was looking for a career change which was tricky as it was hard to get a job up north for what I wanted. Not only that, but a priest from a parish south asked me to make a addition for the church to build on what I had done previously so it all seem to work in timing.\n\nOnce completed, I moved in with another sister who had her partner away on work in which she also needed some support and appreciated me being here with my niece and nephew. Meanwhile I realised for work that I'm not meant to do what I wanted to and secured myself a good paying position in my current trade and things were looking up.\n\nHowever, my sister's partner is set to return home so I got myself a temporary place to stay. My job has gone downhill and I can't do anything to change it, I've had some financial difficulties arise and I feel like all the change that I've experienced this year may fade away as I return back to my life as it was before I moved up North (Trade is toxic and depressing and doing the right thing almost impossible).\n\nI decided a new move to sales for my next job and start again as alot of my problems stem from my previous life down here and in my original line on work.\n\nYesterday, I facetimed my sister up north and I was so happy to see my beautiful nephews who are growing up fast. Made me realise I miss them and the friends I made up there and nothing down here is holding me back now I've decided that the reason for moving down here (employment) has changed anyway whilst my sister and her extended family north all are Catholics and have been a good influence on my life for the time I was up there. \n\nI feel like once again, I should head North but am just not sure if it's just me running/drifting from my problems here or if I'm meant to be part of a greater plan up North with them again.\n\nI'd appreciate any advice especially from anyone whose had a life journey as such. Thanks so much for reading this as long as it is as I just need a second opinion on this side of my life. God bless you all.\n\n\n",

And I would be mortifying my will. But that doesn't seem like a good idea.\n\nReligious life is objectively more perfect (and therefore more meritorious) than secular life.  \nBut is it true regardless of the holiness of the superior?  \nWould it be a good choice to make a vow of obedience to a superior/community you know are lax, just to have the merit of obedience consecrated by the vow?\n\n",

        "body": "First, the vow of obedience is primarily to the rule. Those constitutions are supposed to have been approved by the church, which is where they derive their authority, and also where the superior derives their authority to command. (thus the difference between obeying a random person on the street and a superior). The constitution/rule doesn't arbitrarily change, and it's rare any changes do happen. The idea is that obeying the RULE is your fastest way to perfection. Second, the superior isn't allowed to command anything contrary to the rule, or anything sinful. Given that your superior is not commanding contrary to the rule nor commanding sin, your ability to grow in holiness should not be dramatically hindered by an unholy mother superior. If they ARE commanding such things, no one should be entering that community: how on earth could that be a good thing to take a vow to obey a rule if you know you won't be able to obey it in that monastery? \n\nSecondly, prudence is a virtue that always needs to be practiced, even those in religious life though it will look different for them. For example, in the Carmelite nuns, before asking permission for some exception, they are supposed to pray and discern whether they really need that exemption. Of course, they could get permission and they would be able to do what they want in obedience, but constantly getting exemptions can negatively impact your own soul. You can't just pawn off all responsibility for your soul onto the superior (although they have a lot of that responsibility): you are still responsible for your own soul. The same goes for someone discerning religious life: the problem of unfaithful monasteries has existed for all time, and in the early church they had to be discerning about what monastery they went to. For someone discerning religious life, prudence would dictate you shouldn't enter a monastery that runs more like a company than a monastery. \n\nTo your question: Religious life is objectively more perfect (and therefore more meritorious) than secular life. But is it true regardless of the holiness of the superior? I would say usually yes unless they are commanding against the rule or commanding sin. To your last question, no, it would not be a good choice to make that vow of obedience to a lax community. God will always maintain a faithful remnant of those in religious life, leaving us some faithful monasteries to which he wishes to call people, even if other monasteries choose to be unfaithful to their vocation. There will always be a good option."

One, there's a good chance they aren't living the rule, and there's a good chance the superior commands things against the rule. Two, because according to Alphonsus Rodriguez, an old writer about religious life, one of the chief benefits of religious life is the good example of the other brothers. St Jerome, along with probably hundreds of other saints, praise the value of religious life for the good example you receive. Being deprived of this is no small loss. Third, the whole purpose of religious life is the pursuit of perfection. To not pursue perfection in the religious life is a mortal sin. If they run like a company, they have probably fundamentally forgotten this aim, thus destroying the character of their religious life. That will affect you too, where you will forget the aim of your life. There are other reasons too.\n\nChoosing between the secular priesthood or being a priest in a lax monastery, that's a false dichotomy. If you were to force my hand to answer your question, I don't actually know the objectively correct answer, but it's not a decision you should have to make. If you want to be a secular priest, or feel called to that, do that. If not, don't. If you want to be a monk who is a priest, then find the best monastery that you can and go there. Maybe it won't be as fervent as it could be. Maybe there will be issues there. But then trust our Lord that since you sought out the most fervent monastery you could, that it will be fine and you'll be able to reach the highest degree of holiness you are capable of. And don't go trying to enter a lax monastery. \n\nSecular priesthood and monastic life are fundamentally different: your objective if you are a priest is to sanctify the church and you are supposed to have already reached a certain degree of perfection. Your objective if you are a religious is to become perfect. \n\nHere's some SSPX communities: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSPX-affiliated\\_religious\\_orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSPX-affiliated_religious_orders)\n\nAlso, if you are interested in communities that are latin mass but not sspx, then there are the Carmelite Monks in Pennsylvania and Colorado, and there are Benedictine monks of Norcia in Italy. (Well, there's probably a ton abroad if you are willing to learn a new language. In my opinion Italian is one of the easier languages to learn, though. )"

I'm not a real authority in any sense. So take what I say with a huge grain of salt.  \n\n\n>What exactly would \"not pursuing perfection\" consist of?\n\nHonestly, I don't have an exact definition. I always took it to mean that you should be aiming for and aspiring to perfection in holiness, and backing that up in your actions. Basically don't say \"I'm at x level, and I want to stay there\" or \"I'm at x level, I want to get to y level, and then stop there\" or \"I'm just here to coast and live my life, I'm not going to try to pursue holiness.\" But that might not be totally accurate, and you can probably find a religious priest that would give you a better description. It might be the case you're just not supposed to say \"I'm just here to coast and live my life, I'm not going to try to pursue holiness.\" I don't know\n\n>If a religious follows the orders (according to the constitutions) that his superior gives and does not disobey any prescription of the constitutions, would that be enough to not be in sin?\n\nYes. (I mean, there are a lot of obvious things that are not going to be treated in the constitutions, like don't go rob a bank. Assuming you're not sinning in things not treated in the constitutions.) In fact, what you're describing would bring you to perfection if done perfectly (following the rule)\n\n>Sometimes I fear that, by joining a religious congregation, especially a lax one, I could be putting myself unnecessarily in a vulnerable situation, in which the renunciation of my will, my possessions, the cloistering, the separation from family and friends could complicate rather than help me in my seeking for God. Is this concern legitimate?\n\nEntering a lax congregation is not just a vulnerable situation, it's a nearly impossible one. To add an additional note: from what I've seen if you go to a monastery that is lax, not only do you risk the things mentioned before, but you'll find yourself in an impoverished formation program. Sometimes in a deformation program, unfortunately. Back years ago they would at least teach you how to live the rule, but nowadays even that's often not happening. For example, you likely will find yourself not even realizing you're not practicing silence, because you've never see someone actually doing it. Plus there's a chance you'll get sent home anyways for trying to live the life differently than everyone else.\n\nIn regards to entering a good monastery, giving up these things is not going to be harmful or complicate things. There are reasons why you give these things up, and ultimately it is for your own benefit, to grow in holiness. Unless the superior is asking you to renunciation your will to pursue God, these things aren't the things at stake here. \n\n>  \nTo clarify the situation a little. I've always been very inclined to study and contemplation, while I have low physical energy. I see myself as having a phlegmatic-melancholic temperament.\n\nI've been told by a religious mother superior before (not saying it's true or not) that a phlegmatic temperament is really good for monastic life. \n\n>  \nIn the active life congregations I've known, the intensity of activities, the rigor of physical labor, the lack of moments of rest are things that drain my energy, impacting my commitment to activities (even prayer). Even recreation on Sundays (with games and conversations for long periods of time) tired me out (that's not how I rest, but in my cell studying or reflecting on something).\n\nI mean, the issue isn't really these things: there are all types of people, including people that feel like this are in any religious congregation. This is my personal experience, which is very limited, but people that I've met who have been happy in active congregations are those who desire the active apostolate, with the exception of a couple who at the very least have a lack of desire for a heavily contemplative life like monastic life but still have a religious calling. While most who are happy in monastic life have a desire for a lot of prayer and separation from the world. But again, I haven't met a ton of people in either situation."

I love to study. Trust me, if you find an orthodox monastery that has a good library, you won't be missing out. Heck, you'll be grateful for getting 'the baby without the bathwater\" or basically, all the spiritual benefits of the internet without the other things, like reddit. You could choose to avoid monasteries that have no intellectual life, if that would bother you.\n\n>On the one hand, religious life sometimes seems counterproductive to me, giving up vainly the resources that I have, and that I could be a secular priest and follow the way of life that seems more suitable to me.\n\nI promise you that it's not counterproductive. These rules of life were originally written by people who were very holy and very wise, who saw the numerous pitfalls and numerous ways people get sidetracked in their pursuit of God. It's like archery: we may be aiming at the target, but the devil only needs to divert our attention slightly off the course in order to get us to not hit the bullseye, and he'll usually do it by a excess, distortion, or absence of something spiritual. There are congregations that have time to study, but it may be less than you're used to. You'll sacrifice some means of pursuing holiness, but you'll be getting drastically more in return. It's like having a personal dietitian/chef plan and cook the perfect healthy and tasty diet for you, and you saying \"yeah but they don't make very many salads, that's going to make me unhealthy.\" \n\n>On the other hand, when I read some of Saint Alphonsus' writings on the merit of works done through obedience consecrated by the vow, I wonder if the most generous choice would not be to enter religious life and embrace these difficulties out of love. In some of these writings, he says that Dositheus (the the disciple of Dorotheos), for having lived under obedience, enjoys greater glory in Heaven than Anthony the Great; and that pious souls in the world sought shelter under the obedience of any religious congregation precisely because they knew that works done through obedience consecrated by vow yield merits of a greater caliber.\n\nI think of this in terms of the hermits that I've met (some of whom actually do have a vow of obedience). Some are extremely holy, but some of them it's a sort of \"holiness but only on my terms.\" They rather pray than work when work needs to be done, then recreate when they're supposed to pray, then practice penance but only the selective penances they like. Eventually they become people who are so used to doing everything their way without having to deny their will in even the normal everyday things that most laity have to, in their communal relations, that it kind of destroys the point of having become a hermit. The entire reality of religious life or eremitical life is that it's a holocaust offering: a whole burnt offering of yourself. Not having to conform your will to another's (be it a superior's or directly God's in the case of a good hermit) is antithetical to that. \n\nNow, when Thomas Aquinas talks about hermits, he brings up an objection about obedience. He replies that since you are supposed to already be perfect before entering upon the eremitical life, having already been tried in monastic life, that those hermits don't need an external practice of obedience to a superior but rather they already have the practice of obedience in readiness of mind. So I don't know what to make of Saint Alphonsus here. But if you go and meet 10 religious in good monasteries, and then 10 hermits, you'll see what he means. Here's the link in the Summa: [https://www.newadvent.org/summa/3188.htm#article8](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/3188.htm#article8)\n\n>How do I solve this puzzle, which one is the most generous choice?\n\nI think philosophically, entering monastic life in a zealous monastery. In practice, you'll have to figure that out for yourself. You could just go visit a monastery and see how you like it. I've been told you shouldn't get caught up too heavily on what the \"most generous choice\" or highest philosophicaly is in the theoretical, that God actively wills people to all sectors of life to reach the highest degree of perfection there and that you should do what God desires for you as a subject. (Ie think of both Thomas Aquinas and St Alphonsus). Maybe that's modernist, though, I don't know. I honestly don't know of my own accord what the right answer is. I'm not a spiritual director."

Same with the Rule of St Albert. I am coming up with a guess for how to deal with this, but. I guess I would fall back on just visiting good reputable monasteries and getting a feel for the Benedictine Spirit, and then discern a community based off of how they live that spirit. (for the benedictine example) And focus more on their fervor and having the right priorities. That's my best guess, I don't know if that's a good answer. I probably shouldn't be giving advice considering that you have a spiritual director, so maybe just ignore that.\n\n>I know of an austere monastery where they don't eat meat at meals, but they do eat candies at recreation.\n\nLol, as do I. Also a lot of rules, idk about the rule of St Benedict, forbid eating outside of meals, so that would ban something like that. Repeating my weak guess of a response from above, if I went with the spirit of Benedictines, and the spirit of what religious life is about, evaluating the basic things like the austerity, the silence, etc, I would guess that will guard against this. On the converse, there are sometimes things in a rule that you can break without it really being an issue. Like the Carmelite Nuns constitutions have something about keeping all the monastery money in a chest with 3 locks. \n\n>How can we compare, in terms of the sanctification of the individual himself, the contribution of the grace of the Holy Orders and that achieved by a monk who lives his Rule?\n\nAs far as I understand it, the graces of Holy Orders are charismatic gifts, that is ordering towards the sanctification of someone else, though I am sure they sanctify the person. I have no idea, ask a theologian. But to answer your question, most monks are either choir monks who are also priests, or lay brothers who get drastically less time in prayer. So given you choose to be a choir monk, there isn't a real debate here between a monk and a secular priest.\n\n>At the same time, in a letter to a young man, he recommends being celibate in one's own home rather than entering a lax monastery.\n\nCan you send me that?

And that is why few priests aspire to perfection in their homes.*\n\n*Whereas, by entering a monastery where observance reigns, he will be free from the worry of thinking about what to eat and what to wear, because his vocation will provide for all these needs. He will not have relatives there to continually bother him with quarrels and business dealings that will keep him in constant turmoil; there will be no women there who could make him lose his peace of mind; there will be no rumors of the world that would distract him from his prayer and recollection.*\n\n*I have said so much on purpose, \"observant monastery,\" because if he wants to enter any other monastery where there is no fervor, it is better to stay at home and make every effort there to save his soul in the most perfect way he can. In a monastery where discipline is relaxed, he will be in danger of being lost. Even if he entered such an Institute with the resolution to devote himself to prayer and to think only of God, led astray by the bad examples of his companions, made an object of ridicule, persecuted by those for whom his example is a tacit rebuke, he will abandon all devotions and end up doing as the others do, as experience proves.*\n\nBut, for that matter, I would check this episode of the SSPX podcast of Vocation Series:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yo\\_Ep8V9rQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yo_Ep8V9rQ)  \nI've liked this content too (in Portuguese):  \n[https://www.salusincaritate.com/2021/02/consagrados-sobre-o-celibato-leigo.html](https://www.salusincaritate.com/2021/02/consagrados-sobre-o-celibato-leigo.html)  \nAnd I was reading the book \"Single for a Greater Purpose: A Hidden Joy in the Catholic Church\".\n\nI was considering this option.  \nBut then I thought, why not become a secular priest?\n\nI am considering entering the seminary of my diocese.  \nIt is corrupt morally and doctrinally, but my spiritual director said that it would be possible to graduate in parallel and survive during the formation period.  \n(From what I have been told, here in Brazil it is very difficult to be accepted a man into a traditional seminary who has not grown up in that environment since he was younger - which is not my case, I'm 27)"

        "body": "I am really sorry about how that monastery went. \n\nSo discernment is basically just the use of the virtue of infused prudence (which resides in the intellect) with the aid of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, 4 of which are aimed at the intellect and one of which (counsel) is particular helpful for discernment. The point of these gifts is because we don't have angelic knowledge, we are still able to make foolish decisions even with perfect infused prudence. So God's counsel makes up for our lack in knowledge to help us make good decisions.\n\nIt's kind of like discerning marriage in this modern era. You could do all the due diligence in the world, marry someone devout from your parish who grew up with your values, get advice from others, pray deeply for God to give you counsel. That woman could still divorce you in 5 years, leaving you with 3 small children. That's a disaster. You can't truly prevent that from happening, and that happened to someone I heard of at my parish. BUT that doesn't mean you choose to not court people ever. You do the best due diligence you can, use your best prudence, pray, etc. And then leave the remaining risk to God's divine providence.\n\nAll you did in that situation is use your prudence to get out. \n\nAlso, in those situations where a professed monk is in a monastery with serious issues, they transfer. Those monks who were older probably didn't leave because they're older and change is hard on them (also they might be lax themselves) but what you didn't see while you were there were the monks that transferred out. I entered and left a monastery like you are describing, and later found out about several of the professed having transferred to more fervent monasteries before I entered. I think it's probably easier if you're in a non-SSPX community.\n\nAlso what I've experienced is that 99% of everyone surrounding any community will tell you that superior is a saint, regardless of that superior's holiness. I don't know why, it's weird."

        "body": "Ok, first that letter by Saint Jerome might be one of the most genius things I have ever read in regards to vocation.\n\nMy experience is that those who live in an active religious congregation, either they don't have the initial desires for contemplation and higher levels of virtue and pursue it weakly, or they struggle badly trying to balance the two, their pursuit of holiness and active apostolates, that they burn themselves out and eventually become lukewarm. Basically, it becomes a question not of shining vs illuminating, but shining brightly (contemplative) or illuminating weakly (contemplative/active). The second thing to consider is: the secular priest exists to sanctify the church, while the religious seeks to sanctify themselves, BUT in the process of pursuing holiness they strengthen the church.\n\nI've never seen secular priests struggle in the same way as contemplative/active religious, but that's probably because I've been surrounded by very holy priests. It's always something I wondered at, that God probably was giving them the grace to become particularly holy despite all their challenges. They seem to have a much healthier contemplative/active balance. Either way, you'd have to ask them about these things.\n\nTo make things complicated: you could join the fssp seminary in the US? It's probably drastically better than a diocesan seminary, though not SSPX, and I've met FSSP priests who entered that seminary at an older age. You could also just give it a shot at your local traditional seminary: who knows? God might work a miracle. Religious visas are a bit of a mess here, though.\n\nIt sounds like you just want to be a secular priest. Am I inaccurate in saying that?\n\nAlso: what I've noticed about lay celibacy is that it tends to be a backup option for people who wanted something else but never managed to make it work. Case in point, there was recently a ceremony in my diocese where 5 women took vows as consecrated virgins. They all had white hair and were very old, which was an odd image considering they were all wearing wedding gowns. I haven't met anyone who actually felt a positive desire for that life. If I were your personal friend or spiritual director, I would advise you to try something else first. I admit to not having read th article or watched the video yet, just giving my fast opinion."

There's a priest from Institute Good Shepherd native from my state.\n\nI realize that changes are not the most comfortable situations for me personally.\n\nI fear that it would be a bit of a distant endeavor and, if it fails, I might end up getting discouraged from the vocation. Being a diocesan priest, one advantage is that I would be close to my family and the people I grew up with who encourage me on this vocational path. On the other hand, I don't really know what damage a corrupt seminary could cause to my faith.\n\n>It sounds like you just want to be a secular priest. Am I inaccurate in saying that?\n\nThat was the calling that awakened in me last year. It was the most natural thing for me, the reference I had the most contact with, religious life didn't even cross my mind. I only started considering it after realizing that the diocesan seminary wasn't well. The vows of poverty and obedience scared me a little from the beginning. Studying about them, the situation improved. But, as discussed, I see a risk in them, a risk that doesn't seem so small to me. I have tried to base my choice, more than on my feelings, on what would be the highest/most generous state I could choose.\n\nThis touches on the question, for example, of the merit of works done out of obedience, as Saint Alphonsus puts it. While he himself says that it is not a good idea to enter a lax monastery.\n\nCould the explanation be something like this: *\"objectively, works done out of obedience consecrated by vow have a higher merit, but taking a vow of obedience under these conditions is unwise\"* ?\n\nThinking of an analogy, it would be something like: *\"giving alms is meritorious, but for a family man to donate all his wealth is unwise\"* or *\"fasting is meritorious, but if you are becoming malnourished, it makes no sense\"* ?"

They just seem to handle it better and be holier. Maybe that's just my limited experience having been around wonderful priests all the time.\n\nOk, to keep this a little shorter: if I were in your shoes, I would visit monasteries and religious institutes, until I found one that seemed really holy. Sometimes reputation doesn't line up with reality: sometimes there are hidden gems of excellent monasteries, and sometimes a monastery has a great reputation but is lax. I would keep visiting them until I found a good and fervent monastery, so that I'm not going to have this \"what if\" about religious life. (I mean, I wouldn't go on for years visiting these monasteries. But at least make a real effort to find a good one.) I promise you there are good communities out there. Then if I didn't want to go to that monastery, or feel any desire to go to any monastery at all in the theoretical, then I would go to a traditional seminary. I have no intent to contradict your spiritual director about going to the diocesan seminary: I'm just saying what I would do. I would be willing to look outside the country if need be. The second thing I would do in your shoes is I would make sure I was attending daily mass as often as possible, going to confession at least monthly, and praying at least 20-30 minutes a day. The reason for that is because I've met people that get \"roadblocks\" in their discernment due to some worry or hangup about something more human, sometimes even closing themselves off to discernment at all because of that. Having a deep prayer life will help you moderate those human desires and put them secondary to the \"one thing necessary.\" I also would try to not get hung up too much on the merit of the vow of obedience, if you really feel called to be a priest: imagine if every priest on the planet did that! That's what I would do in your shoes. I'm also not you, just take all that with a huge grain of salt."

        "body": "Sorry for the lack of response: I went on retreat. \n\nHere are the reasons I wouldn't go to the diocesan seminary:  \nOne: Aristotle says (I paraprase) that the first requirement for a teacher is that the student trusts/believes in them. (I can't find the actual quote, it's in \"faith, hope and love\" by Joseph Pieper.) This is because what teaching relies on is an act of \"human faith.\" That is, outside of a spiritual context, believing some statement on the testimony of another, not because you have actually experienced it or rationally came to that conclusion. If you walk into a store with a blue wall and the shopkeeper says \"hey, don't touch that wall, it was just painted and it's still wet.\" You probably wouldn't go and touch the wall to make sure: you believe him on his testimony, and that's what I'm talking about by an act of human faith. By deduction you can see how important this is in the case of education: every single thing you're taught in the classroom is initially accepted on the testimony of the teacher, although hopefully you eventually understand without having to rely on their testimony. It relies not on the actual truth of the statements being taught, but on your trust/belief in the teacher themselves.\n\nImagine spending 7+ years in seminary, going to classes every day where you don't believe your teachers. Where you have to inbibe and remember information that you don't trust is true, and have to recall that information for essays and tests, study it, etc. I'm thinking especially of your biblical studies: you will possibly be taught a lot of things that are objectively false. Imagine being there for 7+ years in a place where you'll be given a spiritual director that you don't trust nor feel secure obeying, a formator you don't trust, etc. That sounds like hell.¬†\n\nTwo, at the same time you're enduring this environment, you're being deprived of a positive formation. Actual orthodox classes on doctrine, biblical studies, the spiritual life, etc. That is huge: from my experience it seems just not knowing a few basic facts about the spiritual life blocks some people from making progress. Oftentimes in our spiritual life, we'll read a book that didn't have much of an impact at the time, but is extremely helpful to us in 5, 10 years. Reading good books in a good seminary is a huge aid to this. You could respond saying \"yeah but I can read these on my own.\" Ok, so you're going to take the time to read 7 years worth of traditional seminary education reading, in addition to your liberal seminary? \n\nOn number two, it further impacts the quality of priest you'll be. People are spiritually starving. They are thirsting for truth, doctrinally and otherwise. Do you want to be in a position to feed them? Or do you want to be starving yourself? It could be the one writing from a church father that you read in the trad seminary, one word of advice in the seminary, that you put in a homily that changes someone's life. Both your sanctity and that of your flock depend on your formation. Plus there's the sheer fact of the example of good and holy priests in the seminary, which is huge. In my opinion, if you're going to be a priest you minus well be the best one you can be.¬†\n\nThird, I don't know if this is a problem in Brazil, but in the USA we used to have problems with seminaries expelling seminarians for being too traditional.¬†\n\nFourth, think of what you'll be doing afterwards. You don't just go to seminary and then do whatever you want afterwards: you're assigned at a parish. It could be a very liberal parish. Even at the most traditional parishes, you'll have to give people communion on the hand. Then you have extraordinary eucharistic ministers, and don't even get me started on the laity bringing communion to the homebound. Of course as you know, at a diocesan parish this will all be in the novus ordo. Remember: Lex orandi lex credenti. If you go to a latin mass seminary, you will end up in a latin mass parish where these abuses are nonexistent.¬†Can you get through seminary unscathed? Sure. Would I personally choose it? No!"

Through many great trials, moderate alcholism and mental health issues I constantly fall short of any desire to return.\n\nThis all came undone when I offered a big financial and time devoted sacrifice to God for a change to bring someone special into my life to help save my soul in which I found someone who wasn't even close to the one. This made me make some big changes to the way I viewed life and made me set this year aside to get my personal life back on track.\n\nTonight once again after a stressful and disappointing week of setbacks in life find myself wondering if I will ever find my way and faith again. I understand that only the Traditional Faith will lead us to God and refuse to let myself get involved in a relationship with anyone that doesn't want the Tradional Faith. I find myself never fitting in with the youth of the parishes as I have always had a more serious and mature outlook than them when younger and now alot of them my age who are single are successful and critical thinkers whilst I'm a very down to earth and simplistic person.\n\nIt's become harder now I've moved and the only religious contact is long distance with my family who still practice. Now I know that to those in the Faith the answer is simple, just go to Church. For me though, my whole life has been seeing religion rift the family apart and when I struggled, fell and had no one there to help me on a personl/mental in the years I've been alive.\n\nI know it's long and all over the place but all I ask is for prayers (an add to your Rosary would be a great blessing) for a return to the faith, a good confession and also that I meet some friends and hopefully someone special that can help me find my way again as I am too weak to even live my life alone and having a future partner whose strong in the Faith will be the push and support I need to make it right and endure the current struggles\n",

You need to move from dependence to independence on your own, and only once you're there can you expect a fruitful and flourishing marriage when you establish interdependence with another independent person. It seems like you're trying to move from dependence on a bad lifestyle to distract you from the path you're going down to dependence on another person to drag you up the right path. That's not a recipe for success, and is frankly the wrong move to make as someone who is supposed to be the spiritual leader of your family. \n\nTake the list of things you're looking for in a potential spouse and use it instead as a list of things you need to master before you can start looking for a potential spouse. If you're looking for a holy woman, you must first be holy yourself so start taking your faith seriously. Get back to the sacraments, daily rosary, and spiritual reading. If you're looking for a woman who takes care of herself and is fit, attractive, etc, focus on becoming a peak physical specimen yourself. If you're looking for a woman who has her finances in order, work on getting yours cleaned up (use a budget so you can spend less than you earn and invest the difference in low cost, broad based index funds). You want to be the best that you can be for your future wife. You have to take radical responsibility for everything in your life, stop expecting everyone else to pick up your slack. \n\nRight now you probably feel like you're standing at the base of a gigantic mountain looking up to the summit that you want to to be at tomorrow, but you have to realize that that would simply be counterproductive. If an angel came and plopped you right at the peak in an instant you not only wouldn't fully appreciate the position, but you're much more likely to fall right off more or less immediately. Beware of unearned rewards/dopamine/money. Resist the urge to \"get rich quick\", both when it comes to money as well as relationships. You're not a good date away from turning everything around (just think about it from her perspective, why would you want your future wife to be saddled with the job of raising a man child?), you are signing up for a lifetime of slow, methodical change. Yes, from time to time it's good to raise your gaze the to the summit to remind yourself of where you're trying to go, but for the most part keep your head down and just focusing on getting through each day and pleasing God. Do not worry about having the strength to stay on the path for the rest of your earthly existence, you just need to get through today. \"Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof\", so you will never be given more than you handle (just be sure that you're always asking God for the graces He is more than happy to give you). \n\nFocus on making doing the right thing the easy thing, stop fighting your fallen human nature so much. You say you've moved but now you lack any local religious contact, well maybe it's time to move somewhere where you have more of a local group to immerse yourself in. You're the product of the 5 people you spend the most time around, so stack the deck and make sure they as high quality and holy as possible. You say that the youths you've interacted with just don't seem to be on the same wavelength as you; well, you can either try to find a group that you do vibe with, or you can change your attitude and try to fit in (or exert influence on the group and try to improve their attitudes). \n\nThe only \"shorcut\" I would advise is develop an attitude of serving others. Stop expecting everyone else to serve you, to have everything taken care of so life is easy for you; instead do everything you can to do this for others. Not only will this help you immensely as a single person (IMO single people have a duty to help society as much as they can), but it will do so much to help prepare you for marriage, which requires daily sacrifice and putting the needs of your spouse and children before your own. \n\nGet rid of the alcohol, it does nothing for you, and there is no healthy amount of alcohol you can consume. It trashes your sleep, it hinders your social development, and is overall a terrible waste of money. \n\nFoster a habit of reading, as that is the most common habit among successful people. If you don't like reading books, try audiobooks (with the Libby app you can check out audiobooks from your local library for free). Make it non-negotiable, if you don't really like it with enough work you will learn to. For no just focus on making it easy. Start with the book Atomic Habits, as that applies to all parts of your life, especially the spiritual. \n\nWhen it comes to the spiritual, again for now focus on making it easy. Start with fulfilling the bare minimum: attendance at Mass on all Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation. You don't need to be in the state of grace, you just need to go. If you're feeling like you can add in a little more, then just say 3 hail marys right before you go to bed and right when you wake up. The important thing is to start small and only until you've established the habit  can you consider adding more to it. \n\nI'll keep you in my prayers."

Lefebvre was regarded as the most important bishop of the 20th Century by Pope Benedict XVI and the early church didnt need Papal approval for Ordinations so its not like lefebvre was doing some terrible never seen before action. There's also the \"the sspx doesnt have canonical status with Rome\" but that can't be backed up, if Rome thought the SSPX wasnt within the Holy Sees communion why then dont they clarify that? The SSPX can also get a bad name for some of its members disrespecting the Holy Father or something along those lines which is some how used against the SSPX itself too. Also the SSPX doesn't absolutely hate the New Order of the Mass, They Hate irreverence in the Mass. The Early seminarians of the SSPX when Lefebvre wasnt present had celebrated the Novus Ordo in Latin. Lefebvre is a hero, and only wanted the Best for the Church. The SSPX accepts Rome, Accepts Pope Francis as the supreme pontiff. Case closed. (Its crazy I went from calling lefebvre heretic to Hero)"

History tells us that through the establishment of the Archconfraternity the Christian faith was revived, piety multiplied, virtues blossomed, sinners were converted, and God through the Blessed Virgin Mary blessed people who prayed the Rosary fervently. The Archconfraternity has preserved the same way of reciting the Rosary that the Blessed Virgin Mary revealed to St. Dominic and recommended to the people to recite; thus it has existed for more than 800 years, since 1213.**\n\nGraces granted to the Confraternity of the Living Rosary:\n\n**1. The members participate during life and after death in all the merits and indulgences of the Orders of St. Dominic, as well as all the members of the Archconfraternity.**\n\n**2. Members are assured of the special cause and assistance of the countless Saints who once belonged to this Archconfraternity.**\n\n**3. The Rosary Altar is privileged for eternity for all deceased members of the Archconfraternity, as well as for other souls.**\n\n**4. Countless indulgences both complete and partial are granted to the members, which can also be given to the souls in purgatory.**\n\nBut the most beatiful graces are indulgences that we can give to purgatory souls. As Jesus said to st. Gertrude:\n\n**‚ÄúEverytime you deliver a soul from**\n\n**purgatory, you do Me such a**\n\n**favor as if you had redeemed me from slavery**\n\n**and be assured that I will reward you generously‚Äù.**\n\n**Numerous indulgences given to the Archconfraternity:**\n\nPartial Indulgences.\n\n(The condition for obtaining them is: to be in a state of Divine Grace and have the intention of obtaining these indulgences.)\n\n**200 years and 200 quadragene indulgence have members when they carry the Holy Rosary (beads) with them in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary with a contrite heart;**\n\n**Indulgence of 7 years and 7 quadragene on Sundays and feasts of the whole year, equally on all days of the whole Octave: Christmas, Resurrection, Ascension, Pentecost, Corpus Christi and on the Solemnity of the Nativity and Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary.**\n\nFor praying the Holy Rosary, the following indulgences:\n\n**(a) each time 5 tens are celebrated one gains: 40 days (Pope Leo X); 100 days (Pope Innocent XI); 10 years and 10 quadragenes (Pope Sixtus IV);**\n\n**(b) 10 years for each Our Father and Hail Mary  (Pope Innocent VIII); 10 years and 10 quadragenos at each Hail Mary when the Name ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù is respectfully pronounced;**\n\n**(c) every day once only: 10 years and 10 quadragen when we pray together and 50 years when we pray in church (before the image of the Blessed Virgin Mary of the Rosary);**\n\n**(d) whoever prays the entire Psalter (15 tenths, gains still: 40 days (Pope Pius V); 100 days (Pope Leo X); 7 years (Pope Clement VIII); 7 years and 7 quadragenes (Pope Pius V);**\n\n**(e) 140 days when we cause others to pray the Holy Rosary;**\n\n**(f) 100 days for each visit to a Rosary chapel when one says any short prayer for the Holy Father's intention;**\n\n**(g) 100 days for each pious meditation of a quarter of an hour in duration and 7 years for ¬Ω hour in duration;**\n\n**(h) 3 years and 3 quadragene for visiting a sick member and for burying a deceased member;**\n\n**(i) 60 days for every good deed and for attending Brotherhood services.**\n\n**And many, many plenary indulgences: as well as the feast days of Christmas, Easter, the Annunciation, the Assumption of Our Lady, the feast of Our Lady of the Rosary, the Immaculate Conception, and Our Lord‚Äôs Presentation in the Temple, and the day of the enrollement to archconfraternity)**\n\n(Conditions for obtaining plenary indulgence them:\n\n1.sanctifying grace, 2.worthy Confession and Holy Communion 3. prayers for the intentions of the holy father (f. e. Our Father, Hail Mary), must be said out loud (or atleast with lips) as this is prayer of the church, no attachment to any sin)\n\nPrayers for the intentions of the holy father cannot be changed, and they are:\n\ni. The progress of the Faith and triumph of the Church.\n\nii. Peace and union among Christian Princes and Rulers.\n\niii. The conversion of sinners.\n\niv. The uprooting of heresy\n\n**Carry the Holy Rosary with you!**\n\nSource: my God and everything: a devotional book for members of the Third Order of St. Francis of Assisi 1944rr.\n\n**At the request of Fr. Cormier, General of the Dominicans, the Holy Father Pius X, renewed and recognized the former indulgence granted to members of the Holy Rosary, that is, 100 years(!) once a day to those who carry the Holy Rosary devoutly with them. (Pius X, July 31, 1906).**\n\n**In addition, the Holy Father Pius X, October 13, 1906, in an audience, granted this Grace to members of the Holy Rosary that they can gain the indulgences of the Rosary then even if they interrupt the chaplet - after each tenth - whenever.

If it's the latter it probably doesn't matter, they'll both end up in hell.\n3. I know this is hard, but: Don't pray with your husband / wife, but pray for him/her (and tell him/her about that). Both the Orthodox and Catholics forbid praying with heretics, so even for the other side you're doing him/her a favor. You can still pray the rosary by yourself without praying with the other person. I know a convert who had a child with an agnostic woman who does this and it works, more or less. They don't pray together and it's not anyones fault, but it's not that much of a problem and they get through the day.\n\nIf they're converts, then offer up the pain, but if they went into marriage knowingly: every single time it ends up like this, they don't put the faith first, just feelings - only to end up with more pain as the feelings fade. Marriage should not be treated lightly, because the goal of a marriage is to raise children. \n\nI myself broke up with someone because she was Protestant and it was clear to me she didn't share my vision of traditionalism.

        "body": "First, let‚Äôs take a step back and consider the big picture. If the Novus Ordo were invalid, heretical, or ‚Äúnot Catholic,‚Äù it would mean that Christ‚Äôs promises to protect His Church have failed. The Church teaches, and always has, that the gates of hell will not prevail (Matthew 16:18). But those promises apply to the visible Catholic Church‚Äîthe Church united under the Pope (currently Francis) and the bishops in communion with him‚Äînot to small, breakaway groups like the SSPX, sedevacantist groups like the SSPV, or Bishop Williamson‚Äôs so-called ‚Äúresistance.‚Äù Christ founded one visible Church, and it is through that Church that He safeguards the sacraments and the liturgy, including the Novus Ordo.\n\nThe Novus Ordo, promulgated by Pope Paul VI, is the official Mass of the Catholic Church. It is celebrated globally, and while it may feel different from the Tridentine Mass, both forms are valid expressions of the same Catholic faith. To suggest otherwise is to risk undermining the authority of the Church and rejecting her God-given mission to guide the faithful.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to understand that the Church has always had liturgical development. The Tridentine Mass itself wasn‚Äôt handed down as-is from the Apostles‚Äîit was codified only in the 16th century after the Council of Trent. Before that, there were a variety of rites in use. The Novus Ordo is part of this same tradition of organic development, guided by the authority Christ gave to the Church. Vatican II called for reform, and this is the result. It doesn‚Äôt mean the older form is invalid, but it does mean the Church is exercising her legitimate authority in reforming the liturgy.\n\nNow, about the feeling of ‚Äúa different religion‚Äù‚ÄîI understand where you‚Äôre coming from. The externals of the Novus Ordo can sometimes feel less traditional if it‚Äôs not celebrated with reverence or care, but that doesn‚Äôt change the reality of Christ‚Äôs presence in the Eucharist. The same sacrifice of the Mass is offered in both forms. What‚Äôs most important is focusing on Christ in the Eucharist, which is the heart of the Catholic faith, no matter the liturgical form.\n\nFinally, regarding why God is ‚Äúletting this happen‚Äù: God permits challenges, even within the Church, to strengthen and purify us. The liturgical debates today call us to deepen our understanding of what it means to be truly Catholic‚Äîobedient to the Church, united with the Pope and bishops, and faithful to Christ. Instead of wishing for the Novus Ordo to disappear, why not work to ensure it‚Äôs celebrated as reverently as possible? That‚Äôs something you can have a real impact on.\n\nThe Church isn‚Äôt a human invention. She‚Äôs guided by the Holy Spirit, and her liturgy, no matter its form, is always meant to draw us closer to God. Trust in that promise, and remember: the visible Catholic Church is where Christ‚Äôs promises reside."

        "body": "Let‚Äôs dissect your assertions step by step. First, regarding Vatican II as \"an atomic bomb on the Catholic Church,\" even if you stop short of saying it ‚Äúdestroyed‚Äù the Church, you imply significant damage. Such rhetoric conflicts with Christ‚Äôs promises. As Pope Leo XIII reminds us in Satis Cognitum, \"The Church is not something dead; it is the body of Christ endowed with supernatural life.\" By its nature and constitution, the Church is both visible and indefectible.\n\nSecond, your reverence for Archbishop Lefebvre overlooks glaring issues with his actions and theology. He wasn‚Äôt a momentary dissenter; he remained in defiance of lawful authority for over a decade. Pope Leo XIII teaches that \"bishops separated from Peter and his successors lose all jurisdiction.\" Lefebvre went further than just disobedience‚Äîhe effectively attempted to redefine Catholicism. By setting up marriage tribunals outside the Church‚Äôs authority, claiming the SSPX now held the marks of the Church, and denying the validity of the Novus Ordo priesthood on the absurd grounds that a priest‚Äôs lack of belief in transubstantiation invalidates the Eucharist, he teetered into theological error and schism. Even more concerning, his view that authority derives from the people‚Äîa Protestant and Gallican notion‚Äîstrikes at the heart of Catholic teaching. St. Cyprian‚Äôs warning is clear: \"Heresies and schisms arise and are begotten from the fact that due obedience is refused to the supreme authority.\" Lefebvre exemplifies this, creating division rather than unity. He did incredible work for the church but after Vatican II he appeared to lose faith and seemed to think he needed to save the church even by repeated and significant acts of disobedience, (the end does not justify the means) rather than realising the Church saves us. \n\nThird, your fixation on a \"restoration\" of the Church presumes that the Church is not fulfilling her mission. St. Augustine refutes this thinking, declaring, \"The Church will not disappear but shall remain as long as the sun rises and sets.\" The Church‚Äôs unity and authority remain in the communion with Peter‚Äôs successor, not with groups or individuals who set themselves up as arbiters of ‚Äútrue‚Äù Catholicism. Maximus the Abbot reminds us that \"obedience to the Roman Pontiff is the proof of true faith and legitimate communion.\" The SSPX‚Äôs claim to ‚Äúpreserve tradition‚Äù while remaining outside this communion is incoherent.\n\nLastly, disparaging the Novus Ordo undermines Catholic unity. The Church teaches that all forms of the liturgy promulgated by the Pope are valid and sanctifying. Denigrating it as inferior or damaging is not fidelity‚Äîit is division. The Mass, in any form approved by the Church, is the Holy Sacrifice of Christ. The restoration of the Church begins with fidelity to the Pope and the bishops in communion with him. Pray the Mass, Pray the Rosary, yes‚Äî pray also for the virtues of humility and obedience for us all which are essential to being truly Catholic."

Where the heck do you get these last 2 claims from?\n\n\"his view that authority derives from the people\" source?\n\n\"Third, your fixation on a \"restoration\" of the Church presumes that the Church is not fulfilling her mission. \\[...\\]\" then every time the Church has known a restoration, it contradicted Christ' promise?\n\n\"The Church teaches that all forms of the liturgy promulgated by the Pope are valid and sanctifying.\" I know the document you're refering to, it was published before VII, and the Pope didn't say \"this has been and will be true of every liturgy ever\": he simply refered to the ones currently proclaimed."

        "body": "If you think there's 'so much wrong' with my statement, then let‚Äôs actually engage with Church teaching instead of dismissing it outright. The Novus Ordo is a valid, licit liturgy promulgated by the Church under her God-given authority. To deny that is to deny the promises of Christ to His Church. Let me explain why.\n\nChrist‚Äôs promises are directed toward the visible Church, not breakaway groups like the SSPX or sedevacantist movements. In Matthew 16:18, Jesus says: 'You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it.' This Church is not an invisible, nebulous group‚Äîit‚Äôs the visible Church united under the Pope and bishops in communion with him.\n\nThe First Vatican Council affirmed this clearly in Pastor Aeternus: 'The eternal Pastor and Bishop of our souls... willed that in his Church there should be shepherds and teachers until the end of time.' Christ established a tangible, hierarchical Church to safeguard His promises.\n\nPope Pius XII reinforced this in Mystici Corporis Christi: 'They walk in the path of dangerous error who believe that they can accept Christ as the head of the Church, while not adhering loyally to His Vicar on earth.' This makes it clear that rejecting the visible Church or the Pope‚Äôs authority is a rejection of Christ‚Äôs plan for His Church.\n\nThe Council of Trent also settled any doubts about the Church‚Äôs authority over the liturgy: 'If anyone says that the received and approved rites of the Catholic Church customarily used in the solemn administration of the sacraments may be despised... let him be anathema.' The Novus Ordo, promulgated by Pope Paul VI, is one such approved rite. To question its validity (or to despise it) is to challenge the very authority of the Church established by Christ.\n\nSo, if you believe my statement is 'ambiguous' or 'untrue,' I challenge you to provide an actual argument, grounded in Church teaching, to support your claim. Engage with any authoritative source, and engage with the clear promises Christ made to His visible Church. Dismissing the Novus Ordo or the authority of the Pope without proper reasoning isn‚Äôt a Catholic position‚Äîit‚Äôs an emotional reaction. Let‚Äôs discuss this like Catholics who seek truth, not like factions that reject it."

I am very hopeful that Pope Francis will allow a consecration\n and give them a personal prelature. There is so much good the SSPX do but they need to do it within the fullness of the Catholic church. \n\n1. On Indefectibility and the SSPX‚Äôs Claims\n\nYou argue that the SSPX bishops do not claim jurisdiction and remain in communion with the Church (\"not separated from Peter\"), but this assertion doesn‚Äôt hold when weighed against authoritative declarations. St. John Paul II, in Ecclesia Dei Afflicta (1988), clearly stated that Archbishop Lefebvre‚Äôs act of consecrating bishops without papal mandate was a schismatic act that resulted in automatic excommunication. Benedict XVI also confirmed in 2009:\n\n> ‚ÄúUntil the doctrinal questions are clarified, the Society has no canonical status in the Church, and its ministers ‚Äì even though they have been freed of the ecclesiastical penalty ‚Äì do not legitimately exercise any ministry in the Church.‚Äù\n\n\n\nPope Francis was motivated by concerns regarding the lack of valid confessions and marriages within SSPX communities and so granted them faculties in these areas. This was another conciliatory gesture to try and bring the SSPX back into full communion.\n\nSupplied Jurisdiction\n\nThe SSPX‚Äôs invocation of ‚Äúsupplied jurisdiction‚Äù is similarly problematic. Bishop Tissier de Mallerais himself stated:\n\n> ‚ÄúIt is inasmuch as you do not refuse to receive from your priests the ministry which they have the right to exercise for your good... that the jurisdiction that you in a certain way give them will be able to be fruitfully exercised.‚Äù\n\n\n\nWhile Bishop Tissier qualifies this with ‚Äúin a certain way,‚Äù indicating some level of doubt, this statement reveals a flawed theology of jurisdiction indicating that the people can, by their requests, provide jurisdiction. Lefebvre himself also asserted that SSPX clergy derive their authority from ‚Äúthe requests of the priests and the faithful to take care of their souls.‚Äù Such reasoning directly contradicts canon law and even the SSPX‚Äôs own patron saint, as the Catechism of St. Pius X states:\n\n> ‚ÄúThe power possessed by the Hierarchy does not come from the people, and it would be heresy to say it did; it comes solely from God.‚Äù\n\n\n\nLefebvre explicitly stated regarding the replacement to Bishop Mayer:\n\n> \"This is not the case with the new bishop, who has no other basis for jurisdiction than that which comes from the requests of the priests and the faithful to take care of their souls and those of their children, and who have asked him to accept the episcopacy so as to give them true Catholic priests and the grace of the Sacrament of Confirmation. Thus it is clear that the jurisdiction of the new bishop is not territorial but personal, as becomes also the jurisdiction of the priests.......Since the jurisdiction of the bishop is not territorial but personal and has as its source the duty of the faithful to save their souls, if a group of faithful in the diocese calls upon the bishop to have a priest, this group gives by this very fact, authority to the bishop to watch over the transmission of the Faith and of grace in this group, by the intermediary of the priest that he sent.\"(Source: archbishoplefebvre.com)\n\nBy claiming jurisdiction through the consent of the faithful, the SSPX undermines the Church‚Äôs divinely ordained hierarchical structure. The jurisdiction exercised by bishops and priests must be conferred through the proper channels established and maintained by the Church (the visible, hierarchical body that the world knows as the Catholic Church, headed by Pope Francis, and the bishops in communion with him), not derived from a perceived, and necessarily subjective, ‚Äúnecessity‚Äù or popular demand.\n\nMarriage Tribunals and Jurisdiction\n\nHow can you not see the marriage tribunals as depriving the legitimate successors of the Apostles of their authority to a society of priests with no canonical mission? Lefebvre stated:\n\n> ‚ÄúInasmuch as the present Roman authorities are imbued with ecumenism and modernism, and as their decisions and the new laws are in their ensemble influenced by these false principles, it will be necessary to establish substitute authorities to supply for these defects, which authorities will adhere to Catholic principles of Catholic Tradition and of Catholic law. This is the only way to remain faithful to Our Lord Jesus Christ...‚Äù\n\n\n\nBishop Tissier also claimed \"true jurisdiction\" for this Canonical Commission, stating:\n\n> ‚ÄúThe supplied jurisdiction of the Canonical Commission is not habitual, territorial, or permanent, but personal and dependent on the necessity of the faithful. It is a true jurisdiction, not an exemption from the obligation to receive a judgment from the Church and does not usurp any papal authority or divine right. The judgments and acts of supplied jurisdiction, including the episcopal consecrations of 1988, will eventually have to be confirmed by the Holy See.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n---\n."

I'm gonna try to be as synthetic as I can because I don't have much time, but I'll try to answer on everything.\n\nI'm also hoping an agreement, not because I think the SSPX is wrong, but because it's not a normal situation indeed that people who openly proclaim non Catholic things (blessing gay couples, religious freedom, ... religious relativism) would be at high positions of the Church while orthodox Catholics are persecuted.\n\nRegarding \"being in communion\", this has to be defined first. If being in communion with the Pope means \"agreeing with him doctrinaly\", then the SSPX isn't in communion indeed.  \nIf that means \"to be schismatic\", then it need to be proven that the SSPX is in schism.\n\nJohn Paul II and Benedict XVI might have belived that the SSPX was schismatic and/or excommunicated; they have never formally declared it was that way, and more importantly, **they have never done it infallibly**. You keep using Popes as infallible authority; however, when speaking non infallibly, Popes have been wrong many times in history. Why should we not believe Pope Francis when he preaches religious relativism but we should believe him when he speaks against orthodox Catholics like the SSPX?\n\nRegarding jurisdiction, it seems to me you don't see the position of the SSPX as it actually is: they don't say the jurisdiction comes from the people (they would never say such thing), but by the Pope through the case of the necessity (which is brought by the need to give the sacraments to the faithful who are deprived of it, but that doesn't mean the jurisdiction \"come\" from them!\n\nRegarding the marriage tribunals it is true you can't trust people who are religious relativists on their judgment for that. The tribunal the SSPX has set up is not claiming jurisdiction or infallibility, but to guide people.\n\nRegarding the declaration of Archbishop Lefebvre, how else can you describe the Pope against Tradition in so many essential topics? Religious freedom against Quanta Cura?\n\nArchbishop Lefebvre's words here are ambiguous: you could even make them mean sedevacantism. This is not what he defended though. If you read the official SSPX's position, you'll see that indeed that he belived the Pope has materially given up the faith, but he's not saying that the Pope is a formal heretic, nor that he has infallibly declared a heresy. Therefore he didn't deny indefectibility.\n\nAs a general rule, there is a difference between saying \"I will do this even if you forbid me to do it because you're not fighting for Catholicism anymore but for religious relativism\" and saying \"I consider you don't have authority and I don't want to obey you\". If my father orders me to do something bad, I'll disobey; if he forbids me to something good, I'll do it anyway. That doesn't mean I refuse that he has a right of authority over me nor that I substitue my authority to his.\n\n\"This claim aligns more with Protestant sectarianism than Catholic unity. Somewhat ironically, the SSPX has splintered into groups like the SSPV and The Resistance, whereas the Catholic Church, despite her suffering, remains the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church united to the Pope and bishops in communion with him.\"\n\nThis is a human argument. Also, first the SSPX doesn't claim to be \"the Church\", and more importantly... The doctrinal divide within the NO Catholics is much bigger than between the SSPX and the resistance; the only difference is we actually care about doctrine, while the Pope doesn't care that he has got bishops publically proclaiming gay/LGBT marriages and religious relativism, and Institute of the Good Shepherd priests claiming Vatican II contradicts Catholic doctrine within the same groups. There is a huge divide within the ex Ecclesia Dei as well: they have to public positions on the NO and Vatican II, but many members basically believe the same thing as the SSPX. Nobody is spared by the crisis of the Church."

Lefebvre‚Äôs Statements and claim the church is in apostasy \n\nFor example, his infamous 1987 declaration:\n\n> \"The proposal of Cardinal Ratzinger...even if you concede to us a bishop, even some autonomy from the bishops, even if you concede us the whole liturgy of 1962, even if you allow us to continue the seminary and the Fraternity as it is working now, we will not collaborate! It is impossible, impossible because we work in a diametrically opposite direction. You [Cardinal Ratzinger and those he represented] work to the de-Christianization of society and the Church and the human person. We work for Christianization. It is illogical. ROME HAS LOST THE FAITH, MY DEAR FRIENDS! ROME IS IN APOSTASY. I do not speak empty words, only that I tell you the truth! Rome is in apostasy. You cannot have confidence in them. ROME HAS LEFT THE CHURCH, THEY HAVE LEFT THE CHURCH, THEY HAVE LEFT THE CHURCH! It is sure, it is certain.\"\n\n\n\nThis statement illustrates a complete break from Catholic ecclesiology. Lefebvre‚Äôs claim that ‚ÄúRome‚Äù (the See of Peter) had abandoned the faith effectively positioned himself as the sole arbiter of Catholic tradition, rejecting the papacy and hierarchy.\n\nPope St. Paul VI addressed this type of thinking directly in a 1976 letter to Lefebvre:\n\n> ‚ÄúYou refuse to recognize, as must be done, these two ways in which supreme authority is exercised‚Ä¶ In practice, you are claiming that you alone are the judge of what tradition embraces.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThe Church‚Äôs indefectibility ensures that the faith will never be entirely lost within her visible structures, as Christ Himself promised in Matthew 16:18. Lefebvre‚Äôs rhetoric denies this indefectibility, implying that the Church‚Äôs marks (One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic) had ‚Äútransferred‚Äù to the SSPX.\n\nLefebvre stated:\n\n> ‚ÄúI ask you: where are the true marks of the Church? Are they more in the official Church (I am not talking about the ‚Äòvisible Church,‚Äô I am talking about the ‚Äòofficial Church‚Äô) or in us, in what we represent, what we are?‚Äù\n\n\n\nThis claim aligns more with Protestant sectarianism than Catholic unity. Somewhat ironically, the SSPX has splintered into groups like the SSPV and The Resistance, whereas the Catholic Church, despite her suffering, remains the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church united to the Pope and bishops in communion with him.\n\n\n---\n\n3. Restoration and the Role of the Pope\n\nThe restoration of the Church is always ongoing‚Äîa process of renewal within her visible structures, led by the successors of Peter. Lefebvre‚Äôs assertion that the papacy had become the ‚Äúseat of the Antichrist‚Äù is both theologically unsound and contrary to Christ‚Äôs promises. Pope Paul VI reminded Lefebvre:\n\n> ‚ÄúThe mission of discerning and remedying abuses is first of all Ours; it is the mission of all the bishops who work together with Us‚Ä¶ How can you claim to act contrary to the recent Council in opposition to your brethren in the episcopate?‚Äù\n\n\n\nThe Pope is the guardian of tradition, not a single bishop or group acting independently. Lefebvre‚Äôs rejection of papal authority led not to restoration but to schism and division. It‚Äôs worth noting that figures like St. Athanasius, who opposed heresy during the Arian crisis, did so in defense of the Church (including the Council which Athanasius defended) and in communion with the papacy‚Äînot in opposition to it. Lefebvre‚Äôs actions lack such fidelity to the Church‚Äôs hierarchical unity.\n\n\n---\n\nConclusion\n\nLefebvre‚Äôs actions, while motivated by genuine concern for the Church, ultimately resulted in disobedience, schism, and theological error. The restoration of the Church cannot be achieved through defiance of papal authority or the establishment of parallel structures. True restoration lies in fidelity to the Pope and bishops in communion with him. As Paul VI implored:\n\n> ‚ÄúYou break with the Church‚Äôs legitimate pastors and scorn the legitimate exercise of their charge‚Ä¶ You must take the only decision that befits a son of the Church.‚Äù\n\nThe true path to restoration lies in humble submission to the Church‚Äôs hierarchy and trust in the Holy Spirit‚Äînot in setting oneself as the sole arbiter of Tradition"

In his 1991 letter about Bishop Mayer‚Äôs replacement, Lefebvre explicitly said:\n\n\"This is not the case with the new bishop, who has no other basis for jurisdiction than that which comes from the requests of the priests and the faithful to take care of their souls and those of their children, and who have asked him to accept the episcopacy so as to give them true Catholic priests and the grace of the Sacrament of Confirmation.

It‚Äôs baked into SSPX‚Äôs operations. For example, Bishop Tissier talks about ‚Äúreal jurisdiction‚Äù as I previously pointed out , and Bishop Fellay went so far as to set up a convent in Wanganui NZ under what he called the ‚Äúequivalent of diocesan right.‚Äù There is some info on that here, Our History ‚Äì Dominican Sisters of Wanganui Incorporated ‚Äì The Dominican Sisters of Wanganui Incorporated are separate from, and not associated with, the New Zealand Dominican Sisters Incorporated. That‚Äôs not something you do if you think your jurisdiction is supplied or provisional in nature. There is a sense of a real jurisdiction being imposed. And let‚Äôs not forget the SSPX Canonical Commission - where they require oaths on the Gospels and make people swear not to seek redress from a legitimate Catholic tribunal. A tribunal by its very nature presumes jurisdiction, no? If they didn‚Äôt think they had real jurisdiction, what‚Äôs the point of requiring those oaths? This isn't a small bit of jurisdiction here and there to save a soul in danger of death. The longer this separation goes on, the more it looks and smells like a substitute hierarchy! The SSPX need to come back into regular communion ASAP or it will never happen. \n\nOn Ambiguity\n\nYou acknowledge ambiguity in Lefebvre‚Äôs words - his rhetoric often danced dangerously close to sedevacantism, even if he didn‚Äôt fully go there. Fair enough. But why doesn‚Äôt the SSPX apply the same generous reading to Vatican II or Pope Francis? If Lefebvre‚Äôs ambiguous words can be excused as a reflection of his frustrations with the crisis in the Church, why isn‚Äôt the same courtesy extended to Vatican II interpretation or papal comments today? (There is plenty to be said about Pope Francis and whether off the cuff comments should be considered teachings!)\n\nThe SSPX seems quick to call out ambiguities in Church documents as evidence to disregard Vatican II or the authority of the Pope (and to refuse the profession of Faith). But when it comes to Lefebvre‚Äôs words - like calling Rome ‚Äúapostate‚Äù or saying ‚ÄúRome has left the Church‚Äù-it‚Äôs somehow not a problem. This double standard undermines their credibility. \n\nOn Communion and Schism\n\nYou argue that being ‚Äúin communion‚Äù doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean agreement with the Pope, but I‚Äôd counter that true communion involves more than just avoiding formal schism. You need actual submission to the legitimate authority of the Pope and bishops. The SSPX‚Äôs refusal to acknowledge this basic principle is what creates the ongoing tension. When you set up tribunals, chapels, schools, and seminaries outside canonical authority and churn out priests that are not sent by ecclesiastical or canonical authority, that looks and functions like a parallel Church, no matter what it‚Äôs called. Similarly when its telling its adherents that all other Latin Masses are bad or questionable (even when in communion with the local bishop), the mass celebrated by 95% of Catholics is 'evil' and that the SSPX has the only legitimate position... \n\nThe Bigger Picture\n\nYou‚Äôre right‚Äîthere‚Äôs a crisis in the Church, and it‚Äôs deeply frustrating to see doctrinal confusion and scandal. But does the solution lie in setting up your own tribunals, declaring the Pope‚Äôs jurisdiction null in practice, and (in effect) claiming a special role as the arbiters of tradition? That‚Äôs a slippery slope. The SSPX often says it‚Äôs not ‚Äúthe Church,‚Äù but its actions often look like a substitute for it, especially when it operates independently of the Pope‚Äôs authority. Like the archbishop, the SSPX seem to see itself as saving the Church, but the Church saves us, not the other way around. \n\nI think there's a lot more we could talk about with respect to authority and I'd like to look into your argument on the father scenario. I really don't understand the SSPX position on that myself. It seems they have a bit of a novel way of looking at Obedience - \"If we think what the Church/Pope/Bishops are telling us will mean the destruction of the Faith, then we decline to do it, even if the action of itself is not sinful\". I always understood the Traditional teaching on Obedience is that if you are questioning the prudence of directions, then that is not true obedience! Unless something is clearly sinful, then you should be deferring to Lawful Superiors.  \n\nLet‚Äôs not forget that the Church has faced crises before. Is there any real evidence besides the tired argument of St. Athanasius and perhaps Liberius that we can really point to? All the saints I found always just Obey and quietly accept all their trials and injustices (Padre Pio as a recent one).\n\nI think there's more I could/should address in your comment, but like you, I am a bit light on time as well tonight."

I have seen the SSPX accused of many things, but never of believing the jurisdiction comes from the people. If you ask any SSPX priest, they'll tell you they don't believe that.\n\nHowever, it think it's a problem of definition. What does \"coming from\" means? Yes, it is because the faithful need sacraments that the right of necessity exists. It doesn't mean that the jurisdiction comes from the will of the people, and not through the Church, even if people (needing sacraments) is the reason behind jurisdiction. \n\nIn the letter you're quoting, archbishop Lefebvre says this : \"Since the jurisdictional authority of the bishop \\[de Castro Mayer\\] does not come from a Roman nomination, but from **the necessity of the salvation of souls**, he will have to exercise it with a special delicacy and taking special account of his presbyteral council.\" \n\nIndeed, the right of jurisdiction is supplied here by the right of necessity; it doesn't mean it's the people who can grant it. \n\nTo answer the following paragraph, yes the SSPX imitated the structure of diocese because it's the normal Catholic structure: it doesn't mean they claim the absolute right (as opposed to the necessity right) to create everything, including new dioceses etc. \n\n\"A tribunal by its very nature presumes jurisdiction, no?\" It depends what authority is claimed by this tribunal. This tribunal was created because of the abuse in the diocesan tribunals; and the reason they make people swear not to use those is because those tribunals are inflitrated with religious relativism and can't be trusted. That doesn't mean we're claiming jurisdiction!\n\nLet's imagine an bad government that would give really unfair justice, condemning innocent people to death and releasing criminals. If a community decided to create its own tribunals, it doesn't mean they contest the right of their government to have tribunals; it means they temporarily need proper justice, and setting up things that could do the closest thing to what those tribunals are doing, without claiming their authority. \n\nYou seem to be making an Appeal to motive: yes we believe we're compelled by necessity to do those things, it doesn't mean we're claiming this is something else than necessity. Necessity is enough to make us right and to give us the reason we need to do everything to protect the faith.\n\nIt is not indeed a normal situation: but the modernists who break away from tradition are the ones who caused it, not the SSPX, because the SSPX was compelled by its Catholic duty.\n\nOn Ambiguity\n\nLefebvre is dealing with very complex theological issues, so yes indeed on some quotes you can see ambiguities. But those are always solved by other parts of what he did or said. More importantly, he is never said things that are explicitly going against tradition. \n\nVatican II on the other hand is very ambiguous on some issues indeed, but not only it's explicitly against tradition on some aspects (religious freedom), but also it has been systematically interpreted as such by the post VII Popes. The SSPX doesn't care about Vatican II as such: it's the ideas going against tradition whithin it or behind it that it is afraid of. The fact that all of those following popes and more and more Catholics are believing in these ideas going against tradition are proving us right: the fact people who agree with Archbishop Lefebvre are not infiltrated with those modernist ideas is proving him right as well. \n\n\"There is plenty to be said about Pope Francis and whether off the cuff comments should be considered teachings!\" This is the central point: Pope Francis nor Vatican 2 are using infailliblity to claim their contradictory to tradition beliefs: which is why we're not following them. However, some of the things Pope Francis are saying are definitely going against tradition. This doesn't disprove anything against the indefectibility of the Church because he's not saying them infallibly; however, it does mean that he souldn't be followed blindly on everything."

This isn't about guiding people in an advisory capacity; it's about assuming the authority to make binding decisions in a way that directly mimics the canonical jurisdiction that only the Pope and bishops in communion with him legitimately exercise.\n\nIt‚Äôs quite inconsistent for the SSPX to claim on one hand that they are simply guiding people, while at the same time requiring people to swear on the Gospels and submit to their tribunals in place of the diocesan ones. These actions are fundamentally about exercising authority‚Äîreal jurisdiction‚Äîand not merely offering guidance. This isn't just semantics; it's a matter of how authority is legitimately conferred and exercised within the Church's divinely established hierarchy.\n\nThe SSPX tribunal, for example, isn‚Äôt merely offering suggestions for dealing with marriage cases; they are making binding judgments that require the faithful to submit, while instructing them not to seek redress from legitimate Catholic tribunals. This isn‚Äôt something that can be done without proper jurisdiction. If they didn‚Äôt think they had legitimate authority, why the oaths? Why the instructions not to appeal to diocesan authorities - or simply just guidance without the rigamole of a 'canonical commission!'. \n\nThe SSPX's argument that they have the right to do this out of necessity becomes difficult to accept when the language and actions are so clearly about claiming authority that properly belongs to the Church, through the Pope and those in communion with him. To put it bluntly, if it looks like jurisdiction, acts like jurisdiction, and binds like jurisdiction‚Äîthen it *is* jurisdiction. And in this case, it is jurisdiction that hasn't been granted through the appropriate, canonical channels.\n\n  \nYou were obviously incorrect to state earlier that \n\n  \n*Regarding the marriage tribunals it is true you can't trust people who are religious relativists on their judgment for that. The tribunal the SSPX has set up is not claiming jurisdiction or infallibility, but to guide people.*\n\n**Not a Human Institution**\n\nYou brought up the analogy of setting up a tribunal in a corrupt government to ensure justice. I agree with the general sentiment that, in the face of corruption, there is a need for true justice. However, the Church isn't just a human institution. Christ Himself established the Church, with a visible hierarchy and a divinely guided structure. When we act outside of that structure, we risk undermining not just human authority, but divine authority.\n\nThe SSPX‚Äôs actions in setting up tribunals, seminaries, and consecrating bishops‚Äîwithout canonical approval‚Äîare actions that mimic the hierarchical authority of the Church. Even if done with the best of intentions, it challenges the very structure that Christ established. The Church has processes for dealing with perceived corruption or error‚Äîthose processes require obedience, patience, and sometimes suffering, as exemplified by saints like Padre Pio. Setting up parallel systems isn‚Äôt the way."

I'm still hopeful though, change can be unexpected, and some things are going right!\n\nRegarding obedience, I think I answered with saint Thomas' quote (he also tackles the question at IIa IIae question 104 article 5) but ultimately for every new crisis there are new dilemnas and theologians haven't answered everything; however I thing that keeping the faith on everything is what matters the most. \n\nReagarding Pope Liberius, he sadly isn't the only example (although it's the most similar one), there is also Pope Formosus, Pope John XXII etc., but more importantly, saint Paul against saint Peter. I think the general rule we need to remember is that being blindly obedient to the Pope is too comfortable to be true, and we need to stand up to evil no matter how much we love and respect the Pope. Padre Pio, who didn't like Vatican II either, was persecuted indeed and accepted that, but he never compromised on faith, and he never said the NO. Besides, he was not a bishop and wasn't a member of the teaching Church, he didn't have the same duties as Lefebvre (who appreciated him a lot).\n\nI think this crisis won't solve itself is great saints, as tools of God, don't stand up to it and proclaim Tradition, as they've always done, but it's true that so far we parishoners have been nothing more than sinners, unworthy of fighting for the Church of God. \n\nAs a conclusion, a passage of saint Augustine that gives me hope: (Of True Religion, VI, 11) \n\n\"Often, too, divine providence permits even good men to be driven from the congregation of Christ by the turbulent seditions of carnal men. When for the sake of the peace of the Church they patiently endure that insult or injury, and attempt no novelties in the way of heresy or schism, they will teach men how God is to be served with a true disposition and with great and sincere charity. The intention of such men is to return when the tumult has subsided. But if that is not permitted because the storm continues or because a fiercer one might be stirred up by their return, they hold fast to their purpose to look to the good even of those responsible for the tumults and commotions that drove them out. They form no separate conventicles of their own, but defend to the death and assist by their testimony the faith which they know is preached in the Catholic Church. These the Father who seeth in secret crowns secretly. It appears that this is a rare kind of Christian, but examples are not lacking. Indeed there are more than can be believed. So divine providence uses all kinds of men as examples for the oversight of souls and for the building up of his spiritual people.\""

        "body": "You mentioned the need to define what is meant by \"communion\" and \"submission.\" It involves an actual, lived submission to the Church‚Äôs governing authority, not just in teachings on faith and morals, but in matters of discipline and governance as well. The unity of the Church isn‚Äôt only about shared doctrine‚Äîit also involves visible, structural unity under the legitimate authority established by Christ. I think Communion could be looked into by both of us - how do you see the Church seeing it? I understand, without having a reference at hand, it to mean worshipping with all members of the Catholic Church (and obviously that doesn't mean attending a literal clown or surf mass, nor a LGBT wedding). Specifically, refusing to take communion when attending a NO mass, a FSSP mass etc appears to be a clear 'refusal of communion'. \n\nWhen St. Thomas Aquinas speaks of the duty to resist a prelate in cases where faith is in danger, it is about opposing a specific action that is directly sinful‚Äînot about a wholesale rejection of the prelate‚Äôs authority to govern a group of priests, or establishing parallel structures. \n\nI'm not sure about that new advent reference - did you look at the 'reply to objection 2'?\n\n# Obedience to Authority vs. Blind Obedience\n\nYou argue that we should not obey the Pope if he asks us to do something against tradition. True, we must never obey a directive that requires us to sin. But what exactly in Vatican II or the Novus Ordo constitutes a command to sin? Disagreeing with certain prudential decisions of the Church‚Äîsuch as the reform of the liturgy‚Äîdoes not justify disobedience. Disobedience is a far cry from raising legitimate concerns in the proper way. The notion that every decision must be examined by each individual Catholic to determine if it aligns with their understanding of tradition places private judgment above Church authority, which is inherently Protestant. The SSPX & Co were not the first to say that the antichrist sits in Rome and had 'lost the faith'. \n\nThe Church has faced crises in the past, and reform has always been achieved by remaining obedient and suffering in union with the Church, not by setting up independent structures. \n\n# \"Parallel Church\" Argument\n\nYou mentioned that the SSPX doesn‚Äôt want to replace the Pope or create a \"parallel Church\" because Lefebvre didn‚Äôt assign dioceses to his bishops. However, you can‚Äôt deny that the SSPX has, in effect, set up a parallel structure to fulfill roles that belong to the diocesan bishop and the Holy See. The existence of tribunals, seminaries, and the consecration of bishops, all outside of the Pope‚Äôs authority, effectively creates a substitute hierarchy. You may argue that it is out of necessity, but this still amounts to assuming an authority that has not been granted by the legitimate hierarchy.\n\nIf the SSPX truly recognized the Pope's authority, they would not be establishing their own tribunals,  consecrating bishops, seting up (and taking over!) convents etc, without papal mandate. The fact that Lefebvre didn't assign dioceses is irrelevant if, in practice, these clergy function independently of the Pope and establish their own governance structures.\n\n# Critique of the Novus Ordo\n\nRegarding your comments on the Novus Ordo, labeling it \"evil\" is a grave statement. This is a liturgy promulgated by the Pope and celebrated across the entire Church. To declare it \"evil\" is to assert that the Church has officially sanctioned something intrinsically harmful to souls, which contradicts Christ‚Äôs promise that the gates of hell would not prevail against His Church (as well as the Council of Trent anathema on this point). How can you really be comfortable stating something so grave when you have the ordinary magisterium and the entire Catholic Church celebrating this mass. \n\nIf you look at the essence of the Novus Ordo, it is still the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, instituted by Christ. Its validity is not dependent on its perceived alignment with tradition but on the authority of the Church to promulgate liturgical forms. I state again, to claim that the Mass, which the Church has promulgated for the spiritual benefit of her faithful, is evil, is to question the very indefectibility of the Church.\n\n# Appealing to History\n\nYou mention the Arian crisis and how the majority of bishops were in error at that time. We disagree on the historical facts about what that justified. There are at least two encyclicals from pre Vat II popes that pretty clearly state that Pope Liberious was falsely accused here, and that He **sent** Athanasious out (i.e. jurisdiction) - Principi Apostolorum Petro and Quartus Supra."

Also, the main reason of the oath is that people take advantage of the fact the SSPX tribunal doesn't have official authority (which it doesn't have indeed) to try they luck in a different tribunal if they didn't get what they want. \n\n\"To put it bluntly, if it looks like jurisdiction, acts like jurisdiction, and binds like jurisdiction‚Äîthen it¬†*is*¬†jurisdiction.\"\n\nYes when you're not following a bad authority you have to take decisions that make you look like you're considering yourself as the real authority, however that doesn't mean you don't recognize the authority in principle. You keep making an appeal to motive, but I assure you, if we belived that we'd say it, we're not sedevacantists though, we do believe there is still a Pope, no matter how not Catholic the things he (non infallibly) says are.\n\nTbh this sentence from you seems to be proving my point, yes we act like we have jurisdiction, because we have it through the case of necessity, we're not claiming it comes from somewhere else though.\n\n\"You were obviously incorrect to state earlier that \\[...\\]\"\n\nWell...

The reason the SSPX is following as much as possible the canon law structure is because this is a fundamentally a good law, and because the right of necessity doesn't mean we shouldn't seek having the most normalized canonic status as possible. That's literally the perspective we have, if we believed something else we would say it.\n\n  \n\"The Church has processes for dealing with perceived corruption or error‚Äîthose processes require obedience, patience, and sometimes suffering, as exemplified by saints like Padre Pio.\"\n\nI already answered about Padre Pio, you didn't answer what I said. Also, Archbishop Lefebvre obviously thought about it since he personaly met him and said Mass for his canonization after his death. Archbishop Lefebvre only waited for having no other option to act. But he did his duty as a bishop, which is to preserve tradition no matter how persecuted he was. The Church needs obedience, patience, but also the virtue of courage (I'm not sure how you call it, in French we call it strenghth). In the extract I gave you from saint Thomas Aquinas, he explains how correcting a superior is a duty and not an act of pride if the faith is at stake."

Remaining Catholic, in the fulsome sense of the word, isn't just about holding on to the teachings that we believe are true and what we believe is Tradition, and attending a beautiful TLM - it means being united to the Church in a holistic manner, through:\n\n1. **The Profession of Faith-**this includes adherence to all Catholic doctrines, including those taught by the Magisterium, even if non-infallibly which I think is the sticking point for the SSPX - but lets no go down that rabbit hole of the Profession of Faith and rejection by the SSPX. \n2. **Subordination to the Hierarchy-**remaining obedient to the Pope and the bishops in communion with him. I suppose we have argued already about what it means to be 'obedient'. I think we fundamentally disagree. The SSPX say obedience in matters of discpline requires subjective judgement as to whether its a danger to the faith. We won't agree there. \n3. **Sacred Communion-**sharing in the sacramental life of the Church, in union with the Church's visible structures. Again, we've discussed this. \n\nWithout these three bonds, one can't have the fulness of the Catholic faith that Christ intended when He established His Church.\n\n# Archbishop Lefebvre and His Suspension\n\nArchbishop Lefebvre‚Äôs actions, particularly after his suspension, present a major challenge in understanding true Catholic unity. Once he was suspended *a divinis*, he lost the ability to legitimately exercise his ministry within the Church. By that time, Lefebvre was already \"retired\" as a diocesan bishop (Remember, he was called out of retirement by a group of seminarians...) - he held no office that would allow him to act independently. Any authority he might have had to govern, ordain, or consecrate came from the Church, not from himself or from the perceived needs of the faithful.\n\nWhen Lefebvre continued to ordain priests and eventually consecrate bishops without papal mandate, he created a schism. \n\nWe can go down the rabbit hole of the responsibility of bishops in times of crisis, but ultimately, I think it's better to simply look at what Pope St. Paul VI wrote to Archbishop Lefebvre in his 1976 letter. Paul VI appealed to him to remain united to the Church and to trust in the Church‚Äôs guidance. Ultimately, for what its worth (which is nothing), I think he lost faith in the visible Catholic Church, and thought he had to take a whole lot of action to save It (which saves Us). The Pope is not an enemy of Tradition - he is its guardian, and he has the responsibility to guide the Church, even if he does a poor job. \n\n# Quotes\n\nI appreciate the quote from St. Augustine. It‚Äôs powerful and reminds us that even when good men are unjustly driven out, and attempt no novelties in the way of heresy or schism,their response should not be to form \"separate conventicles of their own.\" I'd close my own comment with a couple more. \n\nPope Leo XIII\n\nA*mong the prelates, indeed, one or other there may be affording scope to criticism either in regard to personal conduct or in reference to opinions by him entertained about points of doctrine; but no private person may arrogate to himself the office of judge which Christ our Lord has bestowed on that one alone whom He placed in charge of His lambs and of His sheep. Let every one bear in mind that most wise teaching of Gregory the Great: \"Subjects should be admonished not rashly to judge their prelates, even if they chance to see them acting in a blameworthy manner, lest, justly reproving what is wrong, they be led by pride into greater wrong. They are to be warned against the danger of setting themselves up in audacious opposition to the superiors whose shortcomings they may notice. Should, therefore, the superiors really have committed grievous sins, their inferiors, penetrated with the fear of God, ought not to refuse them respectful submission. The actions of superiors should not be smitten by the sword of the word, even when they are rightly judged to have deserved censure.‚Äù para 37 - Sapientiae Christianae (January 10, 1890) |* \n\nSaint Pius X\n\n*‚ÄúDo not allow yourselves to be deceived by the cunning statements of those who persistently claim to wish to be with the Church, to love the Church, to fight so that people do not leave Her...

That means we should neither believe blindly everything the Pope says (especially in a time of crisis), nor scrutentize everything the Pope says and try to see heresy in it. Archbishop Lefebvre is everything but the latter."

And there are been for sure Popes who publically preached material heresy, like John XXII, and Catholics who resisted them? And according to wikipedia : \"In this list \\[of people excommunicated by the Catholic Church\\] there are two popes (Honorius and Leo I) and five saints (Leo I, Athanasius, Columba, Joan of Arc, Mary Mackillop) who were issued an excommunication by a church authority.\"\n\nWhat's for sure though is that Saint Paul is here to show us that even for saint Peter in person, who was a great saint, arguably the best Pope and the higest authority, standing up to the Pope when the slightest bit of faith is in danger, no mater if we'll be perceived as pridefull or not"

Disobedience is disobedience, either we have to blindly obey the Pope all the time or we don't.\n\n1.

Also, of course it's a novelty, this code is the first canon law code! And anyway, \"suprema lex salus animarum\", as Canon Law states, the supreme law is the salvation of souls. Canon law is not infallible, even if justifies the SSPX's actions anyway.\n\n\"I do have some hope the next consecrations will be given a mandate and that'll be accompanied by a full acceptance by the sspx of the requirements.\"\n\nWell I agree with the first one, but regarding the requirements, if those go against tradition (like make it accept religious freedom), the SSPX won't accept them with the help of God. \n\n[https://fsspx.news/en/news/1988-consecrations-and-accusations-schism-27850](https://fsspx.news/en/news/1988-consecrations-and-accusations-schism-27850)\n\n\"Canon 1013 explicitly states that no bishop may consecrate another without a papal mandate\"\n\nDo you think the SSPX is not aware of that? Of course it is, but Canon 144 gives Supplied Jurisdiction and Canon 1323 and Canon 1324: give the Exemptions from Penalty (including the right of necessity). \n\n\"'ve previously replied regarding the people supplying jurisdiction point, but it is still out there that Lefebvre thought the church supplied, through the needs of the faithful, full and personal jurisdiction to essentially wandering clergy, as opposed to following the actual church authority which Christ setup with Peter and the Bishops.\"\n\nYou're basically repeating your point without considering my arguments nor even adding arguments. Of course Archbishop Lefebvre never said nor believed that, and no matter what the SSPX doesn't believe that.\n\n\"2. Jurisdiction Cannot Be Self-Declared: Archbishop Lefebvre‚Äôs assertion that necessity granted him the authority to act against the Pope's will undermines the Church‚Äôs divine constitution. By the way, doesn't every sede bishop invoke the same state of necessity?\"\n\nSedes all believe and claim different things, and I don't see why this implied *ad personam* argument would impact us. The sedes are wrong to believe the seat is vacant, it doesn't mean they are wrong to believe in transsubstantiation.\n\n\"Pope Paul VI addressed this directly in his correspondence with Lefebvre, stating, ‚ÄúYou are claiming that you alone are the judge of what tradition embraces.‚Äù The Church alone, through the Pope, determines whether a state of necessity exists. Rome repeatedly stated that no such necessity justified Lefebvre‚Äôs actions, rendering his claim invalid.\"\n\nYou keep doing what I already answered. Paul VI was not infallible about everything. Nor are all popes in history. Also, if you don't define \"Rome/the Church/ infallible or not\", generalisations have no value. Seems like you didn't even read me."

Canon 7 on the Sacrifice of the Mass states:\n\n\"If anyone says that the ceremonies, vestments, and outward signs, which the Catholic Church uses in the celebration of Mass, are incentives to impiety rather than offices of piety, let him be anathema.\"\n\nCalling the Novus ordo evil implies you believe it is an incentive to impiety, even when celebrated in accordance with the rules. Is that your position?\n\nThe Novus Ordo was promulgated by the Church under Pope Paul VI with full authority, and as Catholics, we are bound to accept that it is a valid and licit form of the Roman Rite. To reject its Catholicity or validity is to step into schism, contradicting the authority Christ gave to His Church.\n\nWhile critiques of certain aspects of the Novus Ordo‚Äôs implementation are valid, as even Pope Benedict XVI acknowledged, calling it \"evil\" directly opposes the Church‚Äôs indefectibility and the promises of Christ that \"the gates of hell will not prevail against it\" (Matthew 16:18).

        "body": "Claiming that the Novus Ordo is \"not Catholic\" or \"evil\" misunderstands both the nature of schism and the authority of the Church. According to St. Thomas Aquinas (Summa Theologica, II-II, Q.39, Art. 1), schism occurs when someone \"refuses to submit to the Supreme Pontiff or to be united with the members of the Church subject to him.\" Similarly, Canon 751 of the Code of Canon Law defines schism as \"the refusal of submission to the Supreme Pontiff or of communion with the members of the Church subject to him.\"\n\nRefusing to attend the Novus Ordo, or refusing to participate in it even when fulfilling social obligations, can demonstrate a refusal of communion with the Church. This is especially true when such actions are based on personal or unauthorized critiques, as this places private judgment above the Church's authority. The Novus Ordo was promulgated by Pope Paul VI and affirmed as a valid expression of the Roman Rite by every pope since. To reject it categorically is to adopt a Protestant ecclesiology, where individual or minority group opinions are elevated over the universal teaching authority of the Church.\n\nFurthermore, appealing to a \"Brief Critical Examination\" written by an unauthorized body is not a substitute for forming one‚Äôs conscience in line with the Magisterium. The Catholic Church, founded by Christ, possesses the authority to regulate the liturgy, and it is through this authority that the Novus Ordo was promulgated. As Pope Benedict XVI stated, the Novus Ordo and the Tridentine Mass are \"two forms of the same Roman Rite.\"\n\nTo align yourself with the Church, one must submit to her authority and remain in communion with her, rather than fostering division or adopting a cafeteria Catholic mindset. Instead of rejecting the Novus Ordo, the focus should be on ensuring it is celebrated reverently and in line with the Church's teachings. Anything else risks falling into schism and stepping away from the unity Christ willed and mandated for His Church."

It is a post-Temple compilation of rabbinic debates and interpretations of the Law of Moses, written centuries after Christ. While it may preserve some elements of earlier Jewish traditions, it does not hold authority for Christians or reflect divine inspiration. Salvation is found solely in the Church, which is the body of Christ.\n\nRegarding the phrase \"fruit of the vine,\" it is rooted in Scripture (e.g., Psalm 80:8, Isaiah 5:1-7) and was used by Jesus at the Last Supper, long before the Talmud was written. To suggest the offertory prayer stems from a post-Temple rabbinic tradition seems historically inaccurate unless you can provide actual evidence it came direct from the Talmud. Even then just because it appears there does not mean it is not actually derived from Christ. The Jewish people still hold to the old testament, and so we shouldn't be surprised post Christ Jewish prayers hearken back to the same Old Testament we use. Jesus often used language and imagery from Jewish liturgical and scriptural traditions, but He transformed and fulfilled them in the New Covenant.\n\nThe Tridentine Mass, like the Novus Ordo, also draws from the Old Testament. This isn‚Äôt a problem but a testament to the Church‚Äôs understanding of salvation history as a unified whole. As St. Augustine beautifully put it, \"The New Testament is hidden in the Old, and the Old is made manifest in the New.\" This continuity is part of the Church‚Äôs sacred tradition and its liturgy.\n\nThe richness of the Mass, whether Novus Ordo or Tridentine, lies in how it manifests Christ‚Äôs sacrifice for our salvation. Both rites, when reverently celebrated, lead us to the same truth: the Cross and Resurrection. Instead of engaging in polemics, we should focus on fostering personal sanctification and unity within the Church. Let‚Äôs keep our eyes on Christ, the source of all salvation, who calls us to worship Him in spirit and truth."

But it also allowed for the possibility of vernacular use in some cases, as long as it didn‚Äôt harm unity. The Novus Ordo‚Äôs use of the vernacular fits within the Church‚Äôs authority to make decisions about liturgical discipline and matches Trent‚Äôs emphasis on helping the faithful understand and participate.\n\n\n2. Quo Primum and Liturgical Binding: Saying Quo Primum permanently binds all future Popes is just not correct. Sure, it uses strong language about being \"perpetual,\" but that only applied to its disciplinary rules at the time. Popes can‚Äôt bind their successors in matters of discipline, and history shows this clearly. For example, Pope Pius V used the same \"perpetual\" language in Quod a Vobis about the breviary, but Pope St. Pius X revised it centuries later. The same authority that establishes a liturgical rule can change it.\n\n\n3. Vatican II and the Novus Ordo: The reforms from Vatican II, including the Novus Ordo, were made under the Church‚Äôs legitimate authority. Pope Paul VI promulgated the Novus Ordo as a valid and licit form of the Roman Rite. While it‚Äôs fine to critique how it‚Äôs been implemented‚Äîthings like irreverence or abuses have been acknowledged even by Popes‚Äîthat‚Äôs different from saying the rite itself is invalid or ‚Äúevil.‚Äù That kind of claim undermines the Church‚Äôs indefectibility and authority.\n\n\n4. Liturgical Continuity and Adaptation: The liturgy has always developed over time. The Tridentine Mass itself was a reform of older regional liturgies, not something handed down in its exact form by Christ. The Church has the authority to adapt the liturgy for pastoral needs while preserving its core truths. As Pope Benedict XVI said, the Novus Ordo and the Tridentine Mass are ‚Äútwo forms of the one Roman Rite.‚Äù Dismissing the Novus Ordo because of personal preferences or critiques from outside Church authority misses the point of liturgical development and risks rejecting the authority Christ gave His Church.\n\n\n\nIn short, the Novus Ordo is valid and licit, just as the Tridentine Mass is. Trying to pit them against each other misunderstands how the liturgy has always worked and undermines the Church‚Äôs authority. Rejecting the Novus Ordo because of a misreading of history or authority sounds more like Protestant-style individualism than true Catholicism."

The Novus Ordo was promulgated with full papal authority and remains a valid and licit form of the Roman Rite. Isolated events, however controversial, don‚Äôt invalidate what the Church herself authoritatively upholds.\n\nYour reference to St. Athanasius is misplaced. Athanasius defended the Council of Nicaea in communion with the papacy, not in rebellion against it. His fight against Arianism wasn‚Äôt an act of rejecting the Church‚Äôs authority‚Äîit was an act of fidelity to it. By contrast, rejecting the Novus Ordo outright or undermining its validity isn‚Äôt fidelity to Tradition; it‚Äôs a rejection of the indefectibility of the Church, which Christ Himself promised.\n\nUltimately, your stance is subjective. You interpret events like a papal gesture and impose your private conclusions on the entire Church and a form of the rite that has been accepted by the entire Roman Catholic church. In contrast, I‚Äôm simply relying on the unbroken tradition of the Church and the authority of the papacy, which Christ established, to demonstrate how Catholics are called to think and act. To reject the Novus Ordo as invalid or evil is to deny the Church‚Äôs authority and indefectibility‚Äîand that‚Äôs a position that no faithful Catholic can hold."

Tradition is not a weapon we wield to challenge the magisterium; it is safeguarded and authentically interpreted by the magisterium. \nRejecting the magisterium or refusing communion with the lawful Pontiff (or those subject to him) on claims of ‚Äúbeing faithful to God‚Äù risks repeating the errors of Protestantism: private interpretation over submission to Christ‚Äôs Church. We are not called to stand in judgment of Popes or the Church. Rather, we are called to work out our salvation in humility, within the Church Christ founded, which remains united under Peter and his successors. Obedience and unity‚Äînot rebellion‚Äîare marks of fidelity to Christ."

Can you imagine how Catholics of all times in history would react to such a thing? Especially the martyrs of Islam or paganism who died rather that paying respect to those evil false religions. I'm honestly shocked Catholics who aren't religious relativists would still try to defend such a deed.\n\nThere are so many wrong things he did though, like naming cardinal Yves Congar who was condemned by the Holy office (and who admited he peed twice on the door of the Holy Office after his condemnation).\n\n2. \"Your/sspx judgment that the Novus Ordo is ‚Äúhalf Protestant‚Äù is necessarily subjective.

However, a theological opinion contradicting tradition (=saying that the NO, even if it doesn't reflect the Catholic sense of Mass, which is the renewal of the sacrifice of Christ, as demonstrated by the Brief Critical Exam) is materially heretical, even if it's not formally heretical.\n\n\"You can tell a tree by its fruit\". A Pope makes a new ordo which underminds the sense of sacrifice of Christ in Mass. Some Catholics say this will diminish the belief in the sense of sacrifice of Christ in Mass.

We must also remember that when a man reproves his prelate charitably, it does not follow that he thinks himself any better, but merely that he offers his help to one who, \"being in the higher position among you, is therefore in greater danger,\" as Augustine observes in his Rule quoted above. \"\n\n14. When you see all of those bishops preaching against the Catholic faith made cardinals, when you see the faithfull losing faith *en masse* in basic doctrinal points and embracing religious relativism, you have to realize that this is a crisis at least as bad as the Arian crisis.

    "selftext": "Taken from \"The Incredible Catholic Mass: An Explanation of the Catholic Mass\" by fr. Martin Von Cochem, a great German Capuchin Theologian that lived in 17th century\n\n1. For your salvation, God the Father sends His beloved Son down from Heaven. This is the biblical story. \n2. For your salvation, the Holy Spirit changes bread and wine into the true Body and Blood of Christ. \n3. For your sake, the Son of God comes down from Heaven and conceals Himself under the form of the sacred Host. \n4. He even humbles Himself to such an extent as to be present in the minutest particle of the sacred Host. \n5. For your salvation, He renews the saving mystery of the Incarnation. \n6. For your salvation, He is born anew into the world in a mystical manner whenever Holy Mass is celebrated. \n7. For your salvation He performs upon the altar the same acts of worship that He performed when on earth. \n8. For your salvation, He renews his bitter Passion, in order that you may participate in it. \n9. For your salvation, He mystically renews His death and sacrifices for you His precious life. \n10. For your salvation, He sheds his Blood in a mystical manner and offers it up for you to the Divine Majesty. \n11. With this Precious Blood He sprinkles your soul and purifies it from every stain. \n12. For you, Christ offers Himself as a true burnt offering and renders to the Godhead the supreme honour which is its due. \n13. By offering this act of worship to God, you make amends for the glory which you have failed to give Him. \n14. For you Christ offers himself to God as a sacrifice of praise, thus atoning for your omissions in praising His Holy Name. \n15. By offering to God this oblation (something offered to God) which Christ offers, you give Him greater praise than do the holy Angels. \n16. For you Christ offers Himself as a perfect sacrifice of thanksgiving, making compensation for all failures on your part to give thanks. \n17. By offering to God Christ‚Äôs act of thanksgiving you make a generous acknowledgment of all the benefits He has bestowed upon you. \n18. For you Christ offers Himself as the All-powerful Victim, reconciling you to the God whom you have offended. \n19. He pardons you all your venial sins, provided you are firmly resolved to forsake them. \n20. He also makes reparation for many of your sins of omission, when you left undone the good you might have done. \n21. He removes many of the imperfections attaching to your good deeds. \n22. He forgives you the sins, unknown or forgotten, which you have never mentioned in Confession. \n23. He offers Himself as a victim to make satisfaction for a part, at least, of your debts and transgressions. \n24. Each time you come to Mass, you can do more to pay the penalty due to your sins than by the severest work of penance. \n25. Christ places to your credit a portion of His merits, which you may offer to God the Father in expiation of your offenses. \n26. For you Christ offers Himself as the most efficacious peace-offering, interceding for you as earnestly as He interceded for His enemies on the Cross. \n27. His Precious Blood pleads for you in words as countless as the drops which issued from His sacred veins. \n28. Each of the adorable wounds His Sacred Body bore is a voice calling aloud for mercy for you. \n29. For the sake of this propitiatory (appeasing) Victim, the petitions offered during Mass will be granted far sooner than those that are offered at other times. \n30. Never can you pray so well as while present at Mass. \n31. This is so because Christ unites His prayers to yours and offers them to His heavenly Father. \n32. He acquaints Him with your needs and the dangers to which you are exposed and makes your eternal salvation His particular concern. \n33. The Angels also who are present plead for and present your prayers before the throne of God. \n34. On your behalf the priest says Mass, by virtue of which the evil enemy will not be suffered to approach you. \n35. For you and for your everlasting salvation he says Mass and offers that Holy Sacrifice to God Almighty. \n36. When you participate in Mass, you are yourself in spirit a priest, empowered by Christ to offer the Mass both for yourself and others. \n37. By offering this Holy Sacrifice you present to the Blessed Trinity the most acceptable of all oblations. \n38. You offer an oblation precious indeed, of greater value than all things in Heaven and earth. \n39. You offer an oblation precious indeed, for it is none other than God Himself. \n40. By this Sacrifice you honour God as He alone is worthy to be honoured. \n41. By this Sacrifice you give infinite satisfaction to the Most Holy Trinity. \n42. You may present this glorious oblation as your own gift, for Christ Himself gave it to you. \n43. When you participate in Mass correctly, you perform an act of highest worship. \n44. By coming to Mass you pay the most profound reverence, the most loyal homage, to the sacred humanity of Our Lord. \n45. It is the best means whereby to venerate the Passion of Christ and obtain a share in its fruits. \n46. It is also the best means of venerating the Blessed Mother of God and increasing her joy. \n47. By participating in Mass you can give greater honour to the Angels and Saints than by reciting many prayers. \n48. By coming to Mass devoutly, you can also enrich your soul more than by anything else in the world. \n49. For in this act you perform a good work of the highest value. \n50. It is an exercise of pure faith, which will receive a great reward. \n51. When you bow down before the Sacred Host and the sacred chalice, you perform a supreme act of adoration. \n52. For each time that you gaze reverently upon the Sacred Host, you will receive a recompense in Heaven. \n53. Each time you strike your breast with remorse, some of your sins are remitted to you. \n54. If you come to Mass in the state of mortal sin, God offers you the grace of conversion, which can be fulfilled in confession. \n55. If you come to Mass in the state of grace, God gives you an enlargement of grace. \n56. In Holy Mass you sacramentally eat the Flesh of Christ and drink His Blood. \n57. You are privileged to behold with your eyes Christ hidden under the sacramental veil, and to be beheld by Him. \n58. You receive the priest‚Äôs blessing, which is confirmed by Christ in Heaven. \n59. Through your diligence in hearing Mass, you will also obtain physical and earthly blessings. \n60. Furthermore, you will be preserved from many misfortunes that would otherwise befall you. \n61. You will also be strengthened against temptations which would otherwise have vanquished you. \n62. Holy Mass will also be to you a means of obtaining the grace of a holy death. \n63. The love you have shown for Holy Mass will secure for you the special assistance of Angels and Saints in your last moments. \n64. The remembrance of the Masses heard in your lifetime will be a sweet consolation to you in the hour of death and inspire you with confidence in the divine mercy. \n65. They will not be forgotten when you stand before the Judge and will incline Him to show you favour. \n66. You need not fear a long and terrible Purgatory if you already, to a great extent, atoned for your sins by frequently assisting at Holy Mass. \n67. One Mass devoutly heard will do more to mitigate the pains of Purgatory than any act of penance, however difficult of performance. \n68. One Mass in your lifetime will be of greater service to you than many said for you after death. \n69. You will attain a high place in Heaven, which will be yours for all eternity. \n70. Your happiness in Heaven will be increased by every Mass you hear on earth. \n71. No prayers offered for your friends will be as useful as a single Mass offered on their behalf. \n72. You can amply recompense all who have been kind to you by coming to Mass for their intention. \n73. The best help, the greatest consolation, you can afford the afflicted, the sick, the dying, is to hear Mass for them. \n74. By this same means you can even obtain for sinners the grace of conversion. \n75. You can also earn for all faithful Christians saving and helpful graces. \n76. For the Suffering Souls in Purgatory you can obtain much help. \n77. And if it is not within your power to have Mass said for your departed friends, you can by devout assistance at the Holy Sacrifice release them from many torments. \n\nA priest once said:  \n‚ÄúIf Christians only knew how to profit by Holy Mass, they might acquire greater riches than are to be found in all the things God has created.‚Äù",

Also, the community as such is not that strong or united ‚Äì basically, the faithful are divided into two almost unmixable worlds (northern and southern) according to which of the two chapels they attend to and then subdivided into different big families. Your experience as a newcomer might depend on how sociable you are and how close you live to either of the two chapels. \n\nThe other cities with their own priories and somewhat big established communities are:\n\nGuadalajara, in the state of Jalisco.\n\nOrizaba, in the state of Veracruz.\n\nG√≥mez Palacio, in the state of Durango.\n\nLe√≥n, in the state of Guanajuato.\n\nSadly, I can't tell you much about their communities because I've never lived in any of those cities or even visited their churches. But here's a link where you can find more info and maybe contact them:\n\nhttps://fsspx.mx/es/distrito-mexico-31203\n\nThere are other cities in Mexico with SSPX chapels or mass centers but their schedules vary from weekly to sometimes bimonthly, so I would advise to check the main ones first.\n\nI am originally from Mexico City (or CDMX as we call it here) although I currently reside in the state of Puebla, where we have the most beautiful SSPX chapel of the whole country (not exaggerating) but sadly not a priory, so we don't have daily mass, just on the weekends.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you have any other questions!"

When I first arrived, our community was composed of a big family and a few \"outsiders\", totaling 70-80 faithful; now, after many marriages and the arrival of waves of NO refugees, our numbers rose to 200+ faithful so we had to change our location to a bigger and better-equipped chapel. Monterrey is a great place to live!\n\nPros:  \n\\-The District Superior told us that our chapel is becoming a Priory in the near future; we have the infrastructure to house priests, but vocations are lacking.  \n\\-We're a medium-sized community: not too few for us to feel cloistered, not too big for the faithful to get lost in the crowd. We all know each other and we are fairly united.  \n\\-We have many young families with kids (mine included.)  \n\\-Our city is the industrial hub of Mexico. In Monterrey jobs are plenty, and I'm sure you'll find an IT vacancy, especially with native English as a differential skill.  \n\\-Thank God, our state is still very conservative, and we have not succumbed to the approval of homosexual \"marriages\" or legal abortion (yet.)\n\nCons:  \n\\-We don't have weekly Mass. We receive the priests from the District House almost all weekends (excluding every second weekend of the month.)  \n\\-We don't have a school like the other two big cities of the country, Guadalajara and Mexico, but this may change with the establishment of a Priory. A growing number of young families are opting for homeschooling in the meantime.  \n\\-Our chapel is to the West of the city, in the periphery, which, depending on where you live, means a long drive.  \n\\-Our apostolates and groups that promote an active parish life are still in the launching phase. Since our relocation, a year ago, many things had to be reset.  \n\\-Monterrey is one of the most expensive cities to live in the country (if not THE most), but it compensates with higher-than-average salaries than the rest of Mexico.\n\nFeel free to PM me for more info!

The Priest definitely sang the Credo by himself. In fact, I had two people in front of me turn their heads when I sang the first response, and (I could be imagining it) one person actually shook their head in disapproval at me.\n\nMy guess is either that this Church just really doesn‚Äôt get into the singing part, or traditionally, only the Priest and Schola are supposed to sing.

My mother was somewhat a stay-at-home mom, sometimes leaving me with my grandparents when she needed to help with the family business. His mother has always been a working mom which led him to being raised mostly by his nannies; he has mentioned that he disliked being raised by nannies and would not want such a dynamic with our future children. I am very keen to be more active in the early childhood of our children as I have experience with teaching young children and have seen how good and holy education benefits children. However, seems like being a stay-at-home mom might not be feasible for us.\n\n  \nMy boyfriend's career trajectory is in academia, meaning if we would only rely on his income alone, it won't be enough (or we will be rice-and-beans poor). Academia is known to pay peanuts in the early days, with a potential to secure and well-paying job once he gets tenure. He is extremely good at what he does, getting recommendations right and left, but it'll still take him years to earn enough to support a family on one income. Likely, when that time comes, the children would probably already be in school. \n\n  \nAll this means that I would need to work to supplement his income. My career trajectory can make me decent money with the possibility of hybrid work. But I'm aware that even with that, I would need to rely on daycare or other services to manage raising children. I don't have any good role models of moms who have done it well. Apart from St Zelie Martin (St Therese of the Child Jesus' Mom), I don't know anyone else! \n\nWe are planning to start marriage prep soon before engagement so we will be able to consult our priests regarding this, but would really appreciate \n\n1. Testimonies of moms who managed to work and raise a family\n\n2. The realistic challenges, and \n\n3.

After 10 years, this act would have been recited 365,000 times! (and if we said it 3 times a day, it would be over a million such acts in 10 years).\n\nWe see that throughout our lives, many millions of such beautiful prayers will be said, and many sinners will be saved from damnation.\n\nTherefore, I wholeheartedly invite you to this action. If anyone is interested, please leave a comment or like so that we know how many people are in our group :)\n\nPrayer:\n\n**May the most holy, most sacred, most adorable, most incomprehensible and unutterable Name of God be always praised, blessed, loved, adored, and glorified in heaven, on earth, and in the hells, by all the creatures of God and by the Sacred Heart of our Lord Jesus Christ in the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar.

During todays lesson my priest commented on a question that I asked anonymously about why is the Latin Mass getting banned and why we are throwing away two thousand years of tradition. He responded by saying that around 200, the church language had shifted to Latin from Greek and at the Council of Trent they had changed the order of the mass to be said in Latin and other things. I thought it was just codified during that council but I could be wrong. He also had said that many of the people that think they are praying in latin or going to the latin mass believe that they are cooler (he used a different word that i can‚Äôt remember). I was trying to explain to my parents on the car ride home that just because I go to the Latin Mass doesn‚Äôt mean that the prayers we make during the mass somehow take precedence over a novus ordo participant. I also brought up the fact that my priest had said for the external solemnity of Our Lady of the Rosary, ‚ÄúMaybe if Pope Francis had been saying the rosary he never would‚Äôve said all religions lead to God. And maybe there wouldn‚Äôt be so many problems/heresy in the church.‚Äù When i told my parents that, they said that he is disobeying the pope and that he is supposed to be subject to him and to be careful of who i expose myself to. And i was trying to explain that you can disagree with the pope no matter if you are a cardinal, archbishop, or a priest etc. I also explained that everyone including me there pretty much believes that the statement our priest made was true. They responded to say that if everyone believes a certain set of rules, it is a cult but then i soon went on to say that every denomination including Catholic are a cult based off of their explanation. I really need some guidance right now. If y‚Äôall would provide some guidance, that would be greatly appreciated.",

So we agree we're debating between SSPX and sedevacantist, not among SSPX ;)\n\n\nRegarding material heresy, well still Aquinas is a material heretic. I'm of course aware that the dogma hadn't been defined yet, that was my point; the distinction between material heresy and formal heresy is very important one. In order to be a formal (aka proper) heretic, you need to formally deny a dogma. But that's not what the Pope nor VII are doing, of course they are saying things that contradict implications of the dogma, but they've never formally declined any dogma, that's the point.\n\n\nI agree that this could sound like a weird and unnecessary distinction to make; however this is a theological distinction that exists for a reason, we need to know when something's can be formally called a heresy or not.¬†\nNow I do think that whatever Pope Francis is saying is materially heretic, but I don't think he believes he doesn't believe anymore in any dogma, or at least he hasn't said so publicly.\n\n\nThat's actually what I like about the SSPX, they keep a very balanced position even if in the crisis of the Church it is very tempting not to be so, and they don't go farther that's what's needed.¬†\n\n\nWe should actually rejoice that the Pope, despite all he has done that keeps taking people away from the faith, is not a formal heretic; if he said \"I don't believe anymore in the transsubstantiation dogma\", sure things would be more \"clear\", but also it would be a great blow to Church.\n\n\nI keep hoping the liberal tendency within the Church can be replaced by a conservative one, which on the long run could become with God's help a traditionalist one, that's what's happening in my country (France) at least"

Because that's what we would need to qualify him as a formal heretic. Even if a lot of the things he says are obviously be one day condemned as heretical by the Church, this is not the case. In order to be a formal heretic you have to formally refuse a dogma, Pope Francis has done a lot of bad things but he hasn't done that yet. \n\nBeing obstinate is not necessarily even a doctrinal issue, and even in doctrine just because you keep disagreeing with a doctrinal point, as long as you don't deny an infallibly defined truth, you're not a formal heretic. \n\nMy point was of course not to say \"Saint Thomas Aquinas = Pope Francis\", but rather to show that the definition of heresy can be tricky, and that accusing someone of formal heresy isn't something we can do from our personal judgment without prudence. Saint Thomas is one of the greatest saints ever, Pope Francis arguably one of the worst popes ever. The big difference with their material heresies is indeed that the dogma hadn't been proclaimed yet. Material heresy just means someone says something that objectively goes against the faith, wether the person saying it is culpable or not. So yes, technically, Saint Thomas Aquinas was a material heretic (since what he belive on one subject was against the faith), but of course that doesn't mean he should be held accountable because the dogma he argued against hadn't been proclaimed yet. Pope Francis on the other hand has the possibility to know that what he preaches goes against tradition, and also as a pope he has a much greater responsability. However, he doesn't have yet, thank God, negated publically any dogma.\n\nThis might sound like a useless distinction, and also might sound like trying to diminsh the gravity Pope Francis' actions and words; it really isn't. The whole point of the SSPX in using that distinction is simply to try to have a balanced and precise judgment of the crisis. Also if the Church really didn't have a Pope, or if this pope was a formal heretic, this would be a great blow to the indefectibility of the Church, we don't want that.\n\nTake care!"

He also mentions how Pope John Paul II committed similar actions while behind the Iron Curtain and during Ostpolotik. In general, I like the arguments that he makes in that book.\n\nThe SSPX also seems to have the most balanced and reasonable view on the crisis in the Church. It doesn't go so far into sedevacantism, which really does seem to cause despair, but it also doesn't compromise on the Catholic faith instituted by our Lord, Jesus Christ.\n\nI'm also convinced that the SSPX is the reason why the Latin Mass has been preserved in the face of so much suppression.

It seems like a very questionable house and for the Society to agree to its pastoral governance, without seeking the removal of the Prioress, and seems to me to be a grave mistake and highly.... disturbing. There is legitimate resistance in preserving the faith, but in as much as can be, obedience and respect is due to the bishop and the Pope.

The strongest argument is likely that the Church is a visible institution and is one in Faith, meaning that it must be visibly united in Faith. If the laity cannot identify who are Her members and who are not, then this unity has been destroyed and what the Church teaches about Herself as a matter of Faith untrue. To the objection that there are some fringe cases in which it is difficult to tell whether a particular person is a Catholic or not, requiring an investigation and a judgement by authority, one should refer to the error of the beard; simply because it can be difficult to tell exactly when stubble becomes a beard does not prove that cleanshaven-ness or beards do not exist.

I‚Äôve *highlighted* it below.\n\n‚ÄúThe faithful are not permitted to take the consecrated bread or the sacred chalice by themselves and, still less, to hand them from one to another. The norm for reception of Holy Communion in the dioceses of the United States is standing. Communicants should not be denied Holy Communion because they kneel. *Rather, such instances should be addressed PASTORALLY, by providing the faithful with proper catechesis on the reasons for this norm.‚Äù*\n\nHe said that this was a ‚Äúmysterious addition of unknown origin‚Äù, no one knows how it ended up there, and that it‚Äôs also not written in Latin (don‚Äôt remember what language he said it was in). But, now since it‚Äôs there, essentially he can non-initially enforce it (which he says he does not necessarily want or need to do, but he still has that authority).\n\nConcerning the ‚Äúdiscrepancy‚Äù, I noticed in the GIRM on the USCCB website, that peculiar last sentence ‚Äúof unknown origin‚Äù is missing, it‚Äôs *only* in the GIRM on the Holy See‚Äôs website. I feel this is sort of a crucial difference because it can make or break someone‚Äôs argument depending on which version they‚Äôre reading from concerning the faithful‚Äôs right to kneel for communion.\n\nWould appreciate anyone‚Äôs sincere input on this, please fill in the blanks if I‚Äôm missing something here.

His ‚Äúpastoral ‚Äú catechises consisted of telling us it‚Äôs better to recieve on the hand because you are actually ‚Äúasking for Jesus‚Äù.

Drawing pictures of doves or rainbows), the ubiquitous extraordinary Eucharistic ministers slapping Christ into people‚Äôs hands, , the ‚Äúrisen Jesus‚Äù rather than a proper crucifix, etc.  I mean we aren‚Äôt talking about 20 min speed reading express masses, or priest walking around the altar playing the guitar and speaking in tongues, like some Masses I‚Äôve attended or been aware of over the decades.\n\nThat said his attitudes are still certainly questionable. We saw the host being dropped several times (once involving my wife). A parishioner had to run up, pick Our Lord up, and consume it, while the priest looked on uninterested. That suggested to me either he despised Our Lord, or else had no belief in the Real Presence. This is what prompted my wife to try revert back to reception on the tongue (which had been suspended during Covid). Her third and final attempt led the priest to trying to force the host into her hands, leading to her jumping aside to avoid him.\n\nAfter we left that parish soon afterwards, we travelled to a parish where the priests were Jesuits. A beautiful old church (albeit the altar was not completely free of VII vandalism). However the sermon was focused around the Synod on Synodality, which made us uneasy. As we left we met a woman who had travelled from another far away parish. When I asked what brought her there, she looked sad and sheepishly explained that she remembered it from when she was studying in teacher college. She felt she couldn‚Äôt attend her own parish anymore. She said they had completely removed the tabernacle and it felt more like a Protestant prayer group. We shared our own experience as the reason as to why we were there. As we walked out, I told my wife that I knew of somewhere a few streets away that offered the TLM. She said she was willing to have a look. Unfortunately we had missed Mass but lifted a few leaflets and left. I explained about the SSPX to my wife at home later and she agreed to go back and try it the next Sunday. What an experience. A High Mass. The smell of incense pervading, the silence, the rood screen, the Asperges, the Gregorian chant from the Schola, the homily, the demeanour of the people, the bows and genuflections and constant signs of reverence, the people kneeling at the altar rail waiting to recieve Our Lord. When Mass was ended we were positively beaming. I think my first word was ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù\nIt felt like I had spent an hour in Heaven, been granted a foretaste. If that was Heaven, I‚Äôd take it in a heartbeat. My wife was in full agreement. She said she actually felt angry later that our generation had been robbed of that experience. We spoke to the priests and told him our story, and how we had met a woman in a similar sad situation. He said it was sad but increasingly common that Roman Catholics were becoming Roaming Catholics, trying to find a parish which still preserved some modicum of Catholicism.\nAs we left and walked downstairs of the chapel, my young son said ‚ÄúDad, I love the Latin Mass. I want to be an altar boy‚Äù.\n\nThat never happened after the Children‚Äôs Liturgy, that‚Äôs for sure."

To say it was independent of the Roman Pontiff is erroneous, ABL felt that his time was nearing end, and Rome said he could, just had not given the full authority to, but kept stonewalling him. He did what he, in the interest of SAVING souls, was necessary, I am over simplifying it, but his examples use just as many contextual errors as have been thrown out since 1988."

I really think the most prudent thing to do in this situation is go to a diocesan TLM. The SSPX justify everything they do under crisis mode, but it‚Äôs not a crisis if we have a diocesan TLM near us. Hope through prayer and research we reach the same point.

It‚Äôs just a mutilated Catholic liturgy, but still Catholic. Finding out that Ottavani later said he didn‚Äôt have a problem with the Novus Ordo and taking back his ‚Äúintervention‚Äù also gave me a different perspective. I read The Problem of the liturgical reform too, and it expresses valid concerns, definitely some deficiencies compared to the Tridentine mass, but even after reading it I found that the NO is not intrinsically Protestant since it technically doesn‚Äôt express Protestant belief, to my view at least. I bet your diocese needs you way more than that SSPX parish lol. But I know that you‚Äôre in a situation that‚Äôs really tricky so may God help you do what‚Äôs best."

For example, they reduced the number of necessary miracles for a canonization. More importantly, they changed the definition of what's considered being a saint (it used to be someone who practices virtue to a heroic level).¬†\nThe previous process was considered by most theologians as infallible, the SSPX's position is that there is doubt on the infallibility of the new one. The reason the SSPX \"only\" had doubts, and doesn't straight up condemn it, is that it doesn't have the authority to do so (only a Pope could), but the mew canonization is definitely considered problematic¬†\n\n\nSo it doesn't mean all those people aren't saints, it just means we aren't infallibly sure thay they are.

        "body": "It's hard to find a comprehensive list online for something like this, so I asked ChatGPT:\n\nPope Paul VI, during his papacy (1963‚Äì1978), implemented significant reforms within the Catholic Church, particularly in the wake of the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965). These reforms led to the abolition or modification of various offices, vestments, and practices. Below is a list summarizing some of the key changes made by Paul VI:\n\n# Liturgical and Ceremonial Changes:\n\n1. **Triregnum (Papal Tiara):**\n   * **Abolished Use:** Pope Paul VI was the last pope to wear the papal tiara during his coronation in 1963. He subsequently abandoned its use and symbolically laid it on the altar of St. Peter's Basilica. The tiara has not been worn by any pope since.\n2. **Galero (Cardinal's Hat):**\n   * **Abolished Use:** The red galero, traditionally given to cardinals during consistory, was discontinued. Cardinals now receive a red biretta instead.\n3. **Pontifical Court:**\n   * **Reorganization and Abolition:** The elaborate papal court, including titles like \"Prince Assistant to the Papal Throne,\" was significantly simplified. Many ceremonial positions and titles were either abolished or transformed into honorifics without ceremonial functions.\n4. **Liturgical Vestments:**\n   * **Abolished or Simplified:** Several traditional vestments such as the **papal slippers, stockings, and buskins** were discontinued. The use of ornate vestments, such as the **fanon** (a striped papal shoulder cape), was also significantly reduced.\n5. **Sedia Gestatoria:**\n   * **Abolished Use:** This ceremonial throne, used to carry the pope in processions, fell out of regular use under Paul VI. It was later replaced by the popemobile.\n6. **Simplification of the Papal Mass:**\n   * **Reforms:** The elaborate papal Mass was simplified. Many traditional elements, such as the use of the subdeacon, tunicle, and certain intricate liturgical vestments, were abolished.\n\n# Abolished Ecclesiastical Offices:\n\n1. **Abolition of Minor Orders:**\n   * **Subdeacon and Other Minor Orders:** The minor orders, including the subdiaconate, were abolished in 1972 through the motu proprio *Ministeria Quaedam*. These were replaced with the instituted ministries of lector and acolyte.\n2. **Master of the Sacred Palace:**\n   * **Reformed Role:** This office, traditionally held by a Dominican friar and \nfunctioning as the pope's theological adviser, was transformed into the Theologian of the Pontifical Household, with a more academic and less ceremonial function.\n3. **Abolition of Certain Honorific Titles:**\n   * **Examples:** Titles such as \"Patriarch of the West\" were abandoned, reflecting the ecumenical and simplified approach of Paul VI's papacy.\n\n# Liturgical Reforms (Post-Vatican II):\n\n# Missal of 1969 (Paul VI Missal):\n\nAbolition of the Tridentine Mass (1962 Missal): Although not completely abolished, the widespread use of the Tridentine Mass was replaced by the new Mass of Paul VI, which introduced significant changes, including the use of the vernacular, a simplified liturgy, and a revised calendar.\n\nSuppression of Certain Feasts and Prayers:\n\nLiturgical Calendar Reform: The liturgical calendar was revised, leading to the abolition or downgrading of certain feast days and the simplification of the sanctoral cycle. Some traditional prayers, like the Last Gospel at the end of Mass, were also removed.\n\nSacrament of Tonsure:\n\nAbolished: The tonsure, a clerical rite of initiation that marked the entrance into the clerical state, was abolished in favor of a simpler process of admission to candidacy for ordination.\n\nOther Reforms:\n\nPapal Coronation:\n\nAbolished: Pope Paul VI was the last pope to have a coronation ceremony with the papal tiara. He later decided that future popes would not have a coronation but would be inaugurated with a simpler ceremony.\n\nReduction of Ceremonial Protocols:\n\nGeneral Simplification: Paul VI initiated the reduction of numerous ceremonial and courtly protocols associated with the papacy, opting for a simpler, more pastoral approach.\n\nAbolished Practices:\n\nKissing of the Pope's Foot:\n\nDiscontinued: This medieval practice, symbolizing the pope's supreme authority, was quietly discontinued during Paul VI's papacy.\n\nConclusion:\n\nPaul VI‚Äôs papacy was marked by a decisive move towards modernization, reflecting the spirit of the Second Vatican Council. His reforms aimed to make the Church's liturgy, governance, and practices more accessible and understandable to the modern world, often by simplifying or abolishing older, more complex traditions."

This action might be seen as a step toward Sedevacantism, which holds that the current pope is not valid.\n\nNo, because not mentioning a pope's name in the Mass doesn't necessarily mean one subscribes to Sedevacantism. Lefebvre hypothetically could have other reasons for omitting the name, such as protesting certain actions or policies of the pope without rejecting his papal legitimacy. This action could be interpreted as a statement of resistance rather than a declaration of the seat being vacant.\n\nBut this is all hypothetical since I have very little knowledge in the area of Lefebrve omitting JP2's name from the Mass."

        "body": "If you are a Catholic, you do not submit to the laws and teachings of Francis; it is simply impossible to do so without losing the Faith. This man has stated that Luther was ‚Äúwas not wrong about justification‚Äù on his flight returning from Armenia in 2016), that the death penalty is ‚Äòinadmissible‚Äô, and has made it clear that he is a latitudinarian (religious indifferentist). You may try to escape this by saying that he did not teach any of these positions authoritatively, but this is very clearly untenable in the case of the death penalty for:\n1. He changed the catechism to reflect this change in doctrine, and not only changed it, but admitted that the Church had formerly taught the opposite, as if She can err in her teaching: https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20180801_lettera-vescovi-penadimorte_en.html\n2. He taught in Amoris Laetitia, paragraph 83, that ‚Äòthe Church firmly rejects the death penalty‚Äô. He also does this in the context of rejecting abortion and euthanasia in the same paragraph, putting it in the same category as murder of the innocent, which is quite clearly intrinsically wrong. Some people have tried to escape this by claiming that this is simply a change in discipline, a prudential matter. However. The problem with this is that the Church has no discipline concerning the death penalty, for she has never used it (Ecclesia non sitit sanguinem; all executions of heretics were carried out by the State); the State has the right, and even the obligation in certain circumstances, to impose the death penalty *through the natural law*, and the Church cannot take that away. See the following: https://www.vatican.va/content/dam/francesco/pdf/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20160319_amoris-laetitia_en.pdf\n\nYour next thought after this may be simply that the legitimacy of the death penalty is not de fide. This is an untenable position for the following reasons:\n1. St Robert Bellarmine stated in chapter II of De Laicis that one of the heresies of the Anabaptists is their rejection of the death penalty. See an English translation here: https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.260111/page/n11/mode/1up?view=theater\n2. Cardinal Juan de Lugo states also in his Disputationes Morales et Scholasticae (Disp. X, Sectio II, pg. 57), that the heretical Waldensians held the same position. He then goes on to affirm its legitimacy, stating that all Catholic theologians do so also. See the following: https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0rQOAAAAQAAJ&pg=GBS.PA56&hl=en_US (No English translation this time, I‚Äôm afraid, but you could run it through ChatGPT).\n3. Innocent III included the legitimacy of the death penalty in his profession of Faith against the Waldensians. See Denzinger 425 (1948 edition).\n4. Leo X condemned Luther‚Äôs proposition that ‚Äúit is against the will of the Spirit‚Äô that heretics be burned. See Denzinger 773.\n4. The significance of the fact that all Catholic theologians agree is that a moral consensus of the theologians, due to the intimate connexion of their teaching and the Church‚Äôs, is infallible. This is because, if they erred as a whole, then the Church would necessarily be led into error, which is impossible.\n5. The ordinary magisterium of the Church is just as infallible as the extraordinary magisterium, and the ordinary magisterium has taught consistently (in catechisms, sermons, etc.) for centuries that the death penalty is legitimate. If we say that the death penalty is ‚Äòinadmissible‚Äô, then we also have to say that the Church has changed Her teaching, Her teaching which has been taught by the ordinary magisterium. You may retort that the bishops together with the Pope now teach the immorality of the death penalty, which you would believe to be infallible. But this doesn‚Äôt solve our problem, as we now have an infallible Church contradicting Herself. The solution is that infallibility flows from the Pope, and when there is no Pope, the bishops‚Äô teaching is not infallible, for the ordinary magisterium is the teaching of the bishops *together with the Pope*. It is simply more proof that the Holy See is currently vacant.\n\nSo you are stuck; you must submit to the man whom you believe to be Pope, but you are also bound to publicly profess the legitimacy of the death penalty, otherwise you become a heretic and fall out of the Church. Of course, you can simply cling to tradition as taught by St Paul in Galatians 1:8 (and rightly so) and suspend judgement as to the current state of the Papacy, but the fact remains that you do not submit to Francis (presuming you remain a Catholic), and simply recognising him as Pope does not change that, for recognition is not submission to laws and teaching."

        "body": "I think it‚Äôs important to understand the situation within the Church during the early 20th century when Pope St Pius X saw clear dangers within the Church and attempted to brace it against them, then in the middle of that century during the time of the Second Vatican Council, and after that the formation of the SSPX in order to preserve what was in danger of being lost. If you haven‚Äôt already then read the Archbishop‚Äôs ‚ÄúOpen Letter to Confused Catholics‚Äù which explains some of this and also gives more detail on the changes which swept through the Church even before the Council had concluded. Add to that some research on what people like Bugnini were openly admitting they were trying to do, and how much of what we see in the Church today is a continuation of those aims.\n\nFinally, look at the legalities of the society‚Äôs position with all of this in mind. I‚Äôm not saying Canon Law is not important - albeit even Canon Law itself was changed and ‚Äúupdated‚Äù in the early 80‚Äôs. Ironically, sometimes these changes even lent themselves to the SSPXs situation (eg. The section on fulfilling one‚Äôs Sunday obligation). But I think the legal status is perhaps the least important of all these considerations although they can‚Äôt be simply dismissed, of course. Why do I say that?\nWell a couple of things spring to mind. And this is only my personal opinion. We hear Saint Paul write to the Corinthians regarding the Law - the letter of which kills but the spirit of which gives life. Perhaps this is what is in the mind of Pope Francis when he frequently rails against legalism, clericalism and ‚Äúrigidity‚Äù?  Odd then that the opponents of the SSPX, so often liberal in other ways, suddenly switch to being very rigid in their legalism when the status of the society comes up in discussion. We should remember that the highest law in the Church is, and always has been, the salvation of souls. And if the society is saving souls in a time when souls are deserting the faith in record numbers, then who could reasonably argue that it isn‚Äôt carrying out the highest law of the Church while its detractors point fingers and refer to the letter of the law? Finally, the SSPX refer to the law itself stating that they are acting even in accordance, not only in spirit but by the very letter in that they are permitted to legally carry out their ministry and the sacraments without the Ordinary‚Äôs sanction in a time of great need and crisis (re Supplied Jurisdiction). And here it hinges on one‚Äôs opinion - is the Church in crisis at this time? Well, that depends on who you ask.  The SSPX clearly believe that since the changes to the liturgy and the theology at VII, the changes in the faith of laity and clergy alike following this, the closing of churches, the dwindling of clerical and religious vocations since the Council, etc then yes, there is a crisis in the Church that validates the mandates within Canon Law to allow them to carry out their priestly ministries. The same reason that St Athanasius was justified in persevering in administering to the faithful even when the heretical bishops opposed him, even as he was exiled for the umpteenth time by the ecclesiastical authorities of his age. As the Saint remarked- \n\n‚ÄúThey have the buildings, we have the faith‚Äù \n\n\nI hope you research, and pray for guidance, and find the truth in these times of confusion. Be assured of one thing and that is  Christ‚Äôs promise - the gates of Hell will not prevail against His Church.\n\nTo end with another quote by that great saint and Church Father ‚Ä¶.\n\n‚ÄúEven if Catholics faithful to tradition are reduced to a handful, they are the ones who are the true Church of Jesus Christ.‚Äù -St Athanasius"

I'm sure many Novus Ordo schools are happy to present \"Drag Time Story Hour\" etc.   In any event, I would not send my kids anywhere near a public school aka \"DPRK Indoctrination Center\", but some people may have no choice but to do so."

Rome even approved the candidates and all that remained was for Rome to approve a date of the episcopal consecrations. Archbishop Lefebvre soon realized that Rome was just giving him the run around and waiting for him to die. If he did not consecrate the 4 Bishops, the SSPX would have been unable to continue with its mission which is the formation of priests in the traditional methods.¬†\n\nThe Tridentine Mass would not be at the level it is today if the 4 Bishops were not ordained (it‚Äôs an open secret that Rome only tolerates the Ecclesiastical Dei organizations as a way of drawing faithful away from the SSPX in an attempt to eliminate it). If you love the Latin Mass in 2024, you owe a debt of gratitude to Archbishop Lefebvre because he closely followed the dictates of his conscience, recognized the crisis in the Church, and chose to disobey men instead of offending God.¬†"

        "body": "Strange that you should ask this; I‚Äôve just commented on it in another thread. In short, the reasons for not going would be 1) You do not believe that the priest is a Catholic 2) The priest is a vitandus or declared tolerated excommunicate (impossible in my opinion, but also extremely unlikely and easily verifiable if it is possible) 3) There would be a danger to your Faith or scandal to others.\n\nAs to one, the only possibilities are that he is a heretic or a schismatic. As to heresy, I would ask the grounds for the accusation (I believe it to be nonsense). As to schism, those who refuse submission to the Roman Pontiff due to reasonably doubting the validity of his election are not schismatic. See Wernz-Vidal 7:398 (I can provide other references if necessary). To say that our contention that Francis is not Pope due to his blatant heresy is unreasonable is ridiculous; perhaps you may disagree, but the major premise of our syllogism is the common teaching of the theologians and canonists, even if there is a small number that disagree.\n\nAs to 2), as an SSPX attendee, I doubt you are terribly bothered by the prospect of excommunication by the supposed authorities. That said, I find it extremely unlikely that a ‚ÄòSede‚Äô priest has been excommunicated by name, which is what is necessary for us to be forbidden to attend his Mass or request the Sacraments from him.\n\nAs to 3), how would he be a danger to your Faith? First, I doubt that he would preach at a week-day Mass, and second, their preaching is in general good and not dissimilar from the preaching of SSPX priests. Perhaps you would be afraid that he would bring up the question of the vacancy, which perhaps you think might tempt you to believe that the gates of hell have prevailed (a nonsensical idea)? Would a Catholic have been justified in avoiding the Mass of a Molinist Catholic priest in the past simply because he believed that Molinism is blasphemous and leads to atheism (despite it never having been censured), worrying that he may mention it in a sermon and endanger his Faith? He would have very weak Faith if that were the case. In the case of scandal, it must be remembered that there must actually be a person to be scandalised. Who could that be? Also, the answer would be to simply not tell them. The giving up of spiritual benefits due to pharisaical scandal is also only obliged in limited circumstances.\n\nI have one last thing: not receiving Holy Communion at the Mass makes no difference; if you cannot receive Holy Communion due to who is saying the Mass, you also cannot participate (cannot have communicatio in sacris), and it would be a sin to go at all except in the circumstance that you are going to simply be passively present for the sake of civil honour (which you are not). If you are going to participate in the Mass for spiritual benefit, then it makes no sense at all not to receive Holy Communion if you are in a state of grace.\n\nThe justification in law for this is canons 2261 and 2284 of the 1917 code, which allow the laity to approach suspended priests or even undeclared tolerated excommunicates, for the Sacraments for any just reason (wishing to attend daily Mass certainly qualifies according to the commentaries on the canon). The equivalent canon in the ‚Äò83 code is canon 1335, if you believe that one to be in force (which it is not)."

They support gay marriage, gender ideology, late-term abortion, multiculturalism, euthanasia, criminalizing prayer etc.\n\nI can cite Mary Whitehouse's books against libertine permissive society, Samuel Johnson's books, Richard Hooker's The laws of ecclesiastical polity, Quintin Hogg's book on conservatism, Keith G. Feiling's books on the history of the Tory Party and Samuel Coleridge Taylor's works to give the sense of actual Tory beliefs. The other interlocutor will not care however and continue to insist on the parody version because it's the one with power and authority. Your citation of an outdated article from the time of Pope St. Pius X and two 19th Century theologians has the same power as me trying to argue in favour of High Toryism.\n\nWhen you look at Rome, reality collides with fancy imagination. The ultramontanist is not a man who believes in state religion, the Kingship of Christ, defending God's morality and uncompromising hostility to the ideas of the encyclopedists and the philosophes. The ultramontanist at the Court of Rome is still a follower of absolute monarchy, true enough, but he takes it to such a level where The Lord Pope turns into a Vice-God on earth and the Church is a slave to the Vice-God Supreme Roman Pontiff.\n\nThe ultramontanist is otherwise very socially liberal, more likely than not a Jesuit or sympathetic to them, supports radical development of doctrine theology, rules the Roman Court like any other secular Court by having a bank which is embroiled in countless financial scandals, has an affinity for Masonic ideology by emphasizing false ecumenism and equality of all religions and believes with sincere heart that The Lord Pope has the right to alter the deposit of faith through the authority of Christ.\n\nUltramontanists such as Cardinal Ghirlanda SJ believe that The Lord Pope has unlimited power and may even alter the text of sacred scripture itself, and that he is infallible in everything he says and does. Other Jesuits like Cardinals Hollerich SJ and Martini SJ are also stern ultramontanists and incredibly socially liberal. Francis in fact has Cardinal Martini SJ as his role model.\n\nAs much as I like Cardinal Billot and Pope Pius IX, I simply do not live in the 19th Century. The Roman Curia is the source of endless abuse, scandals and heresy. It caused greater damage than Napoleon ever did. Being a mindless flatterer of the Court of Rome has severe negative impacts on one's spirituality and may lead to losing one's faith entirely, plenty of such cases exist. To be a traditionalist in this era wicked era means categorical opposition to the infernal Court of Rome which has the gall to corrupt the faith of Christ.\n\n[https://www.lifesitenews.com/blogs/cdl-muller-theory-of-popes-unlimited-power-contradicts-the-entire-catholic-tradition/](https://www.lifesitenews.com/blogs/cdl-muller-theory-of-popes-unlimited-power-contradicts-the-entire-catholic-tradition/)"

Every autonomous unit holds whatever the local Priest or Bishop claims, whose doubtful orders may sometimes come from an Old Catholic line. One group will teach that Jews go to heaven, the other group will permit meat on Fridays, yet another one will have altar girls.

My sedevacantism is by coincidence, I am forced to endure this regretful situation, at heart I am a regalist whose thought is rooted in the honourable faculty of the Sorbonne and history. \n\nIf we had a Catholic prince, I'd be the first to demand the immediate appointment of another pope when the momentum is great enough.

By 247 to 300 votes it was decided that in the absence of a genuine papal claimant, that EVERYTHING that may have had to do with the Roman Pontiff (dispensations etc.) would automatically descend on the local Bishop (e.g. episcopalism). Furthermore, they discontinued funding, forbade all appeals, as well as communication in temporal as well as spiritual matters with the Papal pretenders. Suffragan Bishops would be invested by the Metropolitan Bishop, and the Metropolitan one would in turn also appoint his successor beforehand without any need of confirmation by the Pope given that he was absent.\n\nThe church continued to exist without the silliness of the ultra-richerist sede groups.

The key element in schism is pertinacious refusal to submit, not refusal to recognise on its own (though I concede that in most cases, it would be unlikely to find the one without the other).\n\nThe only justification, other than stating that one would rather not take advantage of the Church‚Äôs generosity in this regard, for refusing to attend ‚ÄòSede‚Äô Masses (as if Catholic Masses should be placed in different categories according to the theological opinions of the Catholic priest saying them; it is like speaking of a ‚ÄòMolinist‚Äô Mass), is that they are not Catholic.

If it were a matter of divine law (which we hear repeated and asserted as such nowhere else), then St Hypatius would not be a saint, since he removed Nestorius‚Äô name from the liturgy and refused to be in communion with him without a judgement, and in fact defied the rebuke of his bishop: https://web.archive.org/web/20210416223813/https://romeward.com/articles/239752903/an-extract-from-the-life-of-saint-hypatius\n\nSomething also to be mentioned is that you would fall foul of this canon just as much as I would, were Francis legitimately elected and it still in force, for what is required of Catholics is not just verbal recognition and acceptance of the true Pope‚Äôs claim, but also true submission to him. It is no good to say that a man is Pope but refuse to obey him. However, we both recognise that submission to this man would cause the loss of the Catholic Faith, which we are naturally obliged to publicly profess. Hence, it makes very little sense to accuse us of schism, for our actions are substantially the same as yours, as a supporter of the SSPX Resistance. Were we schismatic, which I of course deny, you would be equally schismatic, and your verbal recognition of Francis‚Äô claim would not change that, since you refuse him submission."

I have known about the theological issues with V2 and the New Mass and desired to find a SSPX church, but because it is my only option I go to my local NO Parish to fulfill my obligation and receive the sacraments. I was lucky to have excellent preists, who are mostly orthodox. There is no TLM anywhere nearby, and going into adulthood I'd like to actively be more traditional in my faith rather than mostly going along with the people around me. \n\nDo you guys have any ideas for what I can do to build a more 'traditional faith' at least until I get to a point in my life where I can move to an area with an SSPX chapel or at the very least a Diocesan TLM? \n\nGod Bless",

        "body": "I would have to disagree with Fr. Z on some of his points. I think an important thing to note about the SSPX is that while they will cooperate with some things with Rome, they will only be obedient to what they see as reasonable. For example, if the local bishop does not give permission to the sspx to ordain or build a chapel in his diocese they will do it anyway. (As far as I can see the only source regarding the sspx being able to ordain without permission is from Bishop Fellay. I'm going to have to see actual proof to actually believe thats the case) Those who promote the sspx will use the excommunications being lifted or faculties being granted as a way to act as if the sspx is totally fine, but they seem to ignore Pope Benedict XVI saying they had no Canonical status and that Pope Francis stated he's given faculties for the pastoral benefit of those who attend the sspx chapels. But here's the thing, the sspx bishops are getting older. They will be consecrating bishops sometime in the future, even if they have to do so without permission from Rome. Doing this it can be predicted that they will once again be excommunicated and the faculties of their priests revoked. It's better to stay away instead of try and get involved with the sspx.\n\n\nI should mention some stuff that you're probably never going to hear about or read in a blog because many people outside of the sspx probably don't know these things. Many of these things were my own opinions as well until recently. Those who attend the sspx view the sspx as holding the truth. The sspx views the Novus Ordo as, although valid, a spiritual poison and an offense against God. In their spiritual Warfare book, participating in the Novus Ordo is listed as a sin. If for some reason you are to attend a Novus Ordo Mass for a wedding or funeral you are not to participate and not to receive Communion. In the sspx we really have no actual connection with the Pope or our local bishop, sure we pray for them, but we really just see them as modernists and we don't really abide by their authority unless we think it's reasonable. We pretty much view the sspx bishops as our bishops (they're not, your local bishop is your bishop). Other Latin Mass communities like the fssp and institute are to be avoided, the sspx does not consider them Traditional Catholics. If someone were to leave the sspx to attend a Diocesan chapel or FSSP/institute (and you're no longer at least a friend of the sspx) you will be viewed as putting your soul in grave danger (yes, I was told this by a family member after I told them I left) this is common as many people have gone through similar things with their families if they leave the sspx"

Please dont think that because I left the sspx it means I therefore think Novus Ordo clergy can do no wrong, heresy should be purged out of the Church and corrections should be made. However, this doesn't therefore mean that talking to a sspx priest and taking the sspx position is justifiable as the sspx promotes schismatic views. I'm not sure if you've read my other comments on this post but myself as well as others face scrutiny if we no longer attend the sspx, our family and friends act as if we've pretty much left the Faith. It's also pretty well known that you'll receive scrutiny if you leave. Many people either leave quietly or they have a hard time leaving out of fear. Though it's not said, it's believed that the sspx is the holder of the true Faith and the trustworthy authority, or at least is the correct path to take. In fact, the first time I stopped attending the sspx and went to the local TLM for my Holy Day of Obligation, I was a nervous wreck because we're told that you shouldn't be going to other TLM groups either. There are serious issues of schism that are ignored because you may be less likely to hear heresy. But the thing is, schism is a lot easier to fall into."

Otherwise, the suspension comes from session 23 chapter 8 of the Council of Trent stating: \"Ordinations of sacred orders shall be celebrated publicly, at the time appointed by law, and in the cathedral churches, in the presence of the canons of that church, who are to be invited for that purpose; but, if they are celebrated in some other place of the diocese, in the presence of the clergy of the place; the principal church being always, as far as possible, made use of. But each one shall be ordained by his own bishop. And if any one ask to be promoted by another bishop, this shall by no means be allowed him, even under the pretext of any general or special rescript or privilege whatsoever, even at the appointed times; unless his probity and morals be recommended by the testimony of his own Ordinary; otherwise, he who ordains him shall be suspended from conferring orders during a year, and he who has been ordained shall be suspended from exercising the orders which he has received, for as long a period as shall seem expedient to his own Ordinary.\" The sspx seminary in Germany was explicitly denied permission to ordain yet they did it anyway. https://catholicradar.com/2024/06/28/bishop-voderholzer-prohibits-ordinations-of-pius-brothers-in-zaitzkofen/"

I went to Mass for the very first time when I was 8, and it stuck.  By the time I was 10, going to protestant church with my parents just seemed pointless.

By being followers of a heresy, known to them or not, they are defined as heretics, which St Thomas says is a form of unbelief. \n\nKnowledge of truth must come before belief, and belief before faith.

Canon 2284 extends this provision to suspended priests. From your point of view, SSPX priests are suspended, hence canon 2284 applies to them and they can be approached for the Sacraments.

You can shop around and just go to ol' pastor Bob next town over who has more X or Y. You can walk down a populated metro area and see 50 different churches, religions, sects, and heresies. This is horrible for people. How confusing and alienating is this? It fosters a divided society. Neighbors have nothing in common with neighbor. Your town is now full of anonymous, fluid nomadic-like individuals who don't see eye to eye on basic things. \n\nAlso the sspx isn't afraid of dialogue. Sspx priests have mentioned that it's okay to ask questions about the faith. In the apologetic series on YouTube, a priest says it's absolutely rational and *normal* to question the faith. People are sense-oriented rational animals. No one is going to believe a Catholic apologist if the Catholic can't answer real questions like, \"Why is Jesus God?\" Catholics aren't just blind faith believers. Catholicism at its roots is extremely rational and rewards the inquisitive thinker. That's because the truth is rooted in God, (reality is God who is Being itself) who ultimately is simple and can be known by anyone who desires (to an extent, of course, God is incapable of being known fully for He is infinite in measure.)"

In a generation or two these men will be dead and hopefully their replacements will umpire things.¬†\n\nThat being said, if you‚Äôre trusting the SSPX to provide the sacraments, then you should fully commit to that trust. The SSPX does put a lot of effort into training priests, and for the most part they wouldn‚Äôt allow someone to administer the sacraments if there was genuine cause for doubt. Ultimately we are still living through a Crisis in the Church, and as lay people we can‚Äôt be reasonably expected to perform canonical investigations into every member of the clergy we come across. We won‚Äôt find ourselves in Hell because we failed to discover a defect of matter in the ordination of the priest who was eventually consecrated as a Bishop.¬†\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if after the Crisis is over the Vatican starts investigations into all of these issues and does what it can to rectify the problem (similar to how once a monastery discover they had been celebrating Mass for 10 years using apple wine, the Vatican stepped in and had every single one of the masses ‚Äúrecelebrated‚Äù and enlisted the rest of the clergy throughout the world to assist), but that‚Äôs pretty much the only entity with the capacity to do so.

Thankfully for myself and my family we have found our way into the Catholic church and while there are obvious problems, it has been an immense relief. And to address your statement that the SSPX \"has bee given the ok for the sacraments (?) by the Vatican...\" The SSPX doesn't even make that claim, except for witnessing marriages (with the approval of the local ordinary) and absolution, and THAT privilege was granted only recently by Pope Francis. When pressed, they just go into their word salad about their interpretation around supplied jurisdiction. I've heard it all, and understand it, it's just not logical. It, their claim of supplied jurisdiction, relies on their own judgement that ordinary jurisdiction doesn't apply to them because they said so. Then by extension of that logic, ALL independent \"catholic\" groups have that same jurisdiction, that's chaos. And it's protestant. I have seen so many things over the course my life, but especially over the last 10 years or so, that would strongly suggest that the SSPX has no will to ever enter into full communion with the Catholic Church. The mere suggestion back in 2012 caused a huge split. Any real movement toward legitimacy would cause a massive- and possibly fatal- fracture.

It's in the Catechism of the Crisis in the Church book by Angelus Press as well as heavily discussed in their podcasts and videos ad nauseum. A quick Google search would show you this. Multiple Vatican officials have publicly said that the sspx fulfills one's Sunday obligation and that they are not in schism. Also, if the sspx were really outside of the church then they would not even be considered in \"irregular communion.\" Pope Francis would have crushed their legitimacy by now. \n\nThe whole crisis in the church today is complex and unfortunately, to the detriment of souls, extremely difficult. At the end of the day, there's an obvious rupture of orthodoxy within the church. If it's not clear to you, I have nothing to say.

Barcelona: Editorial Herder, 1985, p. 458).\n\nSem rodeios, essa dign√≠ssima autoridade do Vaticano acusou o documento¬†Gaudium et Spes¬†‚Äì do Vaticano II ‚Äì de desempenhar um papel de Anti Syllabus. Enquanto o Syllabus √© caracterizado por sua oposi√ß√£o aos princ√≠pios do mundo moderno, o documento do Vaticano II expressa a inten√ß√£o de reconcilia√ß√£o oficial da Igreja com a civiliza√ß√£o moderna, nascida a partir da Revolu√ß√£o Francesa. Portanto, segundo o Cardeal Ratzinger, o Vaticano II ensinou o contr√°rio do Magist√©rio precedente, mais especificamente, contra o Syllabus do Papa Pio IX."

Nunca houve nada semelhante na hist√≥ria da Igreja, pois todos os ritos evolu√≠ram org√¢nica e gradualmente. A pr√≥pria possibilidade de tal coisa ocorrer nunca foi concebida anteriormente. O Cardeal Ratzinger, no pref√°cio da obra *A Reforma da Liturgia Romana* de Mons. Klaus Gamber, afirmou o seguinte:\n\n> O que ocorreu ap√≥s o Conc√≠lio √© algo completamente distinto: no lugar de uma liturgia fruto de um desenvolvimento cont√≠nuo, introduziu-se uma liturgia fabricada. Escapou-se de um processo de crescimento e de devir para entrar em outro de fabrica√ß√£o. N√£o se quis continuar o devir e o amadurecimento org√¢nico do que existiu durante s√©culos. Foi substitu√≠do, como se fosse uma produ√ß√£o industrial, por uma fabrica√ß√£o que √© um produto banal do momento. \\[...\\]\n\nNoutros tempos, qualquer afirma√ß√£o relativa a uma verdade de f√© que fosse imprecisa e que desse margem para compreens√µes heterodoxas seria condenada como err√¥nea e perigosa (n√£o necessariamente her√©tica), especialmente em contextos onde falta de clareza pode minar o dogma da f√©.\n\nA nova missa est√° numa situa√ß√£o an√°loga a essa. As defici√™ncias e ambiguidades da nova liturgia, n√£o expressando precisamente a f√© cat√≥lica na presen√ßa real e no sacrif√≠cio, s√£o falhas graves. Noutros tempos algo semelhante a isso na liturgia seria condenado pela Santa S√©, que j√° condenou coisas muito menos graves que isso. S√£o raz√µes suficientes para justificar a mal√≠cia inerente do *Novus* *Ordo*, independente de ser bem ou mal celebrado.\n\nMe restrinjo a dizer isso sobre o *Novus Ordo*, n√£o tenho interesse em prosseguir essa discuss√£o. Se voc√™ quer buscar a verdade quanto a esse assunto, estude. Discuss√µes online s√£o geralmente in√∫teis e infrutuosas. Mas perceba que as raz√µes pelas quais os tradicionalistas sustentam suas posi√ß√µes n√£o s√£o infundadas e levianas, s√£o raz√µes s√©rias, embora um ou outro argumento possa estar errado.

They don‚Äôt care about following the rubrics because it would make the Mass less about their needs and more about God. You can‚Äôt serve both. This is also why people who hate the TLM think it‚Äôs purely about the language (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt speak Latin‚Äù). The reformers did a damn good job\nmaking people forget ‚Äîor never learn‚Äî that the NO is not the vernacular TLM. \n\nThe NO is to the TLM what a Whopper is to a fine dark chocolate truffle."

They are just repeating it as read from someone else.\n\nThe motivation, I would guess, is basically an attempt to push back against the fact that the New Mass is an innovation dating back 60 years. So they will try to put the TLM on a similar footing by saying it only goes back to the Middle Ages, or to the Council of Trent, or even that it was constantly being changed right up until Pope Pius XII. The inference is there that it‚Äôs not that old itself, or at one point it was an innovation just like the NOM. Anything to try and make the NOM seem less like the  jarring novelty that it is.\n\nTheir arguments are not even coherent.\nFor example, they talk about rigidity of the old and the need to move with the times. Then they claim their mass is actually somehow closer to an older form of the mass than the TLM and thus are using antiquity as a pejorative trait for the TLM but somehow a (false) positive selling point for the NOM.\nIn a similar vein, Modernism at its core believes in the need for things to evolve and change over time to better suit the current environment (unfortunately, for them this also applies to radical departures from core beliefs), but when it‚Äôs explained that the TLM gradually and organically evolved over the centuries to become what it is today, they use this as a point of accusation to somehow state that it has been corrupted from its original form.\n\nThere is no consistency to their arguments because they are arguing in bad faith. Their underlying reason is simply to score points, try to assuage their own underlying doubt, and win the argument at any cost. Things like accuracy and facts all take a very distant second to just appearing to win the argument and silencing their critics."

        "body": "There are sedes who say that the pope MAY not be the pope, but lack the authority to dispose of him (early SSPV priests like Fr. Jenkins). Effectively it's close to the R&R position, but without the \"pope-sifting\" that the SSPX has to do on what to accept and what to reject, they just reject everything that comes out of Rome as dangerous.\n\nThen there are sedes who say that the pope definitely IS not the pope, putting their own judgement above the papacy and quoting various saints out of context to support their position (like Fr. Cekada). Then they develop various theories on how this could've happened while preserving their definition of the indefectability of the Church, whether they should elect their own pope (Palmarian Church with \"Pope\" Michael, Conclavism), develop theories on who is and isn't a heretic, theories on whether we should pray \"una cum Papa Francesco\" during Mass and whether it's mortal sin to pray for the pope. It's basically Catholic fundamentalism, all while painting sedevacantism as an \"easy\" alternative to R&R while ignoring the glaring holes in the theory.\n\nSedevacantist priests (from the SSPV) weren't banned from the SSPX in the early years as long as they didn't preach with **certainty** that the pope is not the pope (also the SSPV priests didn't get kicked out because of sedevacantism, but that's another story). It's perfectly fine to have doubts whether the pope is not the pope or to expect that he will be disposed of in the future. It is however wrong to dispose him yourself, because that is effectively conciliarism.\n\nThe modern SSPX (post 2012) is sliding towards Rome again (see Bp. Williamsons rhetoric on the \"neo-SSPX\") and the SSPX also has taken in a large influx of liberal-ish Novus Ordo Catholics who are already scared of being labeled schismatic. Most people are also not informed on sedevacantist theory.\n\n> I think informed discussions with protestants often lead to protestants becoming catholic, so I don't see why the same approach is not used with sedevacantists to bring them into the fold of the Church.\n\nBecause sedevacantists see the R&R position as stupid. Sedevacantists are fully aware of the SSPX. They think that if you have a pope, you have to obey him in everything he says in order to fulfil the \"submission to the Roman pontiff\" requirement. And that a true pope can never preach heresy because in order to be pope you have to be a Catholic and not a heretic, yada yada. And they might even be right and we are following a fake pope, but until a future pope declares the current one null and void, the sedevacantist theory stays a THEORY, period. \n\nYes, they might be correct that the pope is not the pope, but what should we do in the meantime, while he hasn't been disposed of? In the words of Fr. Gregory Hesse: \"In the Last Judgement, if I did my best to follow the rules in a time of confusion, can God condemn me to hell? No. But if I say that the pope is not the pope, and in the end it turns out that somehow he is the pope? Then I'll have a problem.\""

The definition of heresy is the pertinacious denial or positive doubt of something to be believed with divine and Catholic Faith (something de fide). The denial or doubt must also be direct, meaning that there can be no intermediate steps of reasoning between a proposition and its contradiction with something de fide, so even if you believe that the Sedevacantist position logically leads to the denial of de fide dogma, it cannot be heretical unless it directly contradicts it with no intermediate steps. This is especially true if the person holding the position refuses to accept that their position logically leads to a contradiction. It is worth noting that so-called ‚Äòecclesia-vacantism‚Äô (the idea that there are currently no diocesan bishops or a current hierarchy) which is often conflated with Sedevacantism by Sedes and non-Sedes alike, likely is heretical, if not seriously erroneous. However, this erroneous idea is not inherent to believing the Holy See to be vacant, contrary to what people like Don Tranquillo assert. The response in short is the appointment of Catholic bishops through common error as to the identity of the Pope. Laymann (Confessor to Ferdinand III) also strongly supports this position. I would also ask what your accusation of heresy would be; Ss Robert Bellarmine, Antoninus, Alphonsus de Ligouri, Francis de Sales, Cardinal Newman, Wernz-Vidal, Ballerini, Marato, etc. all say what we do concerning heresy and Papal Office. Of course, there is a minority (composed of John of St Thomas, Cajetan, Suarez, Bouix, Billuart, Lagrange etc.) that opposes the majority position based on bad ecclesiology, and you can hold to their position if you like, but it would be ridiculous to accuse doctors of the Church of heresy for holding the much more straightforward position. The rethinking and blatant twisting of the meaning of the texts we cite by people like Siscoe & Salza is also ridiculous.\n\nAs to the accusation of schism, those who refuse to submit to a Pope because they reasonably doubt the validity of his election cannot be considered schismatic. This is taught clearly by Wernz-Vidal giving the example of the situation with Urban VI. I also have quotes from other theologians and canonists teaching the same thing. If this were not true, the Great Western Schism (not properly speaking a schism) would have to be considered a lot messier. I would also point out that nobody who professes the Catholic Faith now submits to Francis, so non-Sede Catholics would also be schismatic if we were due to their refusal to submit to Francis, which is now necessary to refuse to practice the Catholic Faith. This is why Schneider slyly changed the cause of schism from the refusal to submit to the Roman Pontiff to the refusal to recognise him in his catechism, which is a novelty not found in the sources. \n\nAll that said, that is not to say that some Sedes, who might be called sectarian, might be schismatic due to a different reason than their refusal to submit to the man whom you consider Pope. It is possible to become schismatic through refusing communion with other Catholics, and De Lugo states explicitly that this can happen during a period of sede vacante. Sedes like +Sanborn are on very thin ice in this regard."

I also agree that shismatic would not be a correct accusation on the basis that someone holds the position of sedevacante.\n\nI think sedevacantists have a reasonable basis to conclude that Francis is not the Pope, but I am not prepared to make such a conclusion, as I don't think I am in a position to adjudicate this matter. I would liken this to having reason to think someone has committed murder while having not been convicted; I can acknowledge the facts that point to murder and, at the same time, acknowledge that I am in no position to adjudicate the matter.

We have one post-conciliar authority quoted above stating that the intention for attending may or may not have some bearing on the matter in his personal opinion, whereas the other doesn‚Äôt even mention that as a consideration. Regardless - according to the letter of the law there is no issue at all with attending an SSPX mass.\n\nAs for agreeing with everything that came out of Vatican II, well that‚Äôs another topic.

I don‚Äôt think anyone could reasonably claim that they are not celebrating a Catholic rite mass.\n\nSince Canon Law makes no mention of licitness (and the SSPX have an answer to that anyway with an appeal to Canon Law), then it seems quite clear cut that , as Cardinal Oddi stated, it is a Catholic Mass that satisfies your Sunday Obligation and that should suffice to settle any doubts."

Kennedy Hall [gave a pretty good writeup](https://meretradition.substack.com/p/father-rostand-abuse-case-the-full) on a case of an accused SSPX priest that I think is very balanced in light of the delicate subject that can be applied to similar situations. \n\nThe reality is there is no human organization that can be free from the scourges of fallen human nature, but that certainly doesn't excuse it when it happens, especially when those men who commit these grievous sins are supposed to be moral authorities. It also does not absolve us from striving to rid every oragnization we can of the scourge. \n\nSure sexual abuse cases happen at far lower rates in the Catholic Church compared to other organizations, but that again does not excuse the evils committed nor remove any obligation from the leadership to attempt to  eradicate it. Every problem is a leadership problem, and this is certainly one of them. \n\nThat being said, it's important to remember that allegations are allegations, and many times the people who make them are not of sound mind. The whole Church Militant debacle that you're referring to was clearly a half baked attempt to round up every single person with an axe to grind against the SSPX and roll it all into one article. \n\nI spoke with the SSPX District Superior of Asia, Fr. Summers, and he said what he does if there's ever any sort of accusation made against a priest he immediately removes the priest from public ministry and conducts an investigation. If the investigation finds the priest guilty he is dealt with accordingly (I don't recall if this includes handing him over to civil authorities, which I would hope so), but if the investigation exonerates the priest then Fr Summers accompanies the priest and publicly clears him of any wrongdoing and reinstates the priest with a big celebration. I think this is a good strategy that could be used. \n\nIf you zoom out and look at the issue from a 50,000 ft view, we are still as a society figuring how to best deal with this issue, and as imperfect as it is, the Catholic Church (and by extension the SSPX) is on the forefront of fixing it. While it's saddening the clergy have been forced to do so (instead of being proactive and voluntarily putting into place the best practices before there ever was even an issue), it's better than nothing I suppose."

The police failed to do their job to investigate. How is the SSPX at fault if the police doesn't do their job?\n\n- Fr. Pierre Duverger: isn't even charged with a rape allegation, just charged with imprudent words in the confessional. Not even a police report was filed, and the \"20 victims\" of him also haven't filed any report. Church Militant then cites a document specifying how the PR should deal with Church Militant, insinuating that it describes how to \"cover up\", but that's not what the document said.\n\n- Laudenschlager: Was a deacon, fired from a seminary after wanting sexual favors. Is still fired, is now gay and works for Microsoft. He doesn't even associate with the SSPX.\n\n- Peter Palmeri: Three priests didn't report his abuse of his children to the police, because they cannot break their confessional seal. Well, it is what it is, but they cannot break their seal.\n\n- Fr. Novak: didn't do anything sexual, just a very uncharitable person towards some parishioners\n\n- Fr. Philippe Peignot: Allegedly molested a boy and was banned from being around children. Ban was lifted again years later. Only case where I could see a \"coverup\".\n\n- James Simmerman: Millionaire who was charged with a rape allegation by a woman. The SSPX priests that knew him vouched for his character during his lawsuit. Given how quickly and easily rape allegations happen against men with money in the US, I can see why the SSPX would defend him. His case was dropped after a settlement. Doesn't mean he's guilty.\n\n- Fr. Christophe Roisnel: abused children, was reported to police and in the meantime put into a monastery while the case was going on. Church Militant claims that the SSPX \"hid\" him and the police \"found\" him, which is idiotic, the SSPX does cooperate with the police. Again, there was no \"coverup\", he was sent to a monastery while the investigation was going on.\n\n- Kevin Sloniker: was only know for circumcizing himself and was removed from his position as a teacher due to mental instability. He wasn't kept away from children because he wasn't known to molest children. Reported to police and is serving life now.\n\n- Fr. Uribe Silviano Bernabe: raped women, now serving life. Again, not the SSPXs fault. \n\n- Fr. Fr√©d√©ric Abbet: accused of molesting boys, acquitted because of lack of evidence. He was accompanied by his attorney to make sure it doesn't happen again, sadly, it did happen again, now he is serving life in prison. Again, no fault of the SSPX, they did investigate his case but allowed him to be a teacher because the claims couldn't be verified.\n\n- Fr. Stephen Abraham: accused of molesting a boy and then another one 10 years later. Was sent to a monastery after the second case. \n\nThe PDF you linked is literally grasping at straws regarding \"widespread pedophilia support\". With the exception of Peignot, the entire document is a massive nothingburger. You can read most of these stories in a pro-SSPX or anti-SSPX light and given the reputation of the Church Militant after their lost defamation case, I'll still give the SSPX the benefit of the doubt. Meanwhile, in the mainstream Catholic Church, the priests and bishops aren't disciplined at all."

In this letter, Card Cassidy said that SSPX isn't falling under the scope of oecumenism, because it is not in schism, but only in a complex position in terms of jurisdiction.\n\nAnother good argument is the fact that the pope gave jurisdiction to all SSPX priests to give the absolution, all around the world, in 2015, meaning that SSPX is indeed under the authority of Rome."

In fact, these are good to practice and we should be practicing them anyways without making vows. (Depending on your state in life)\n\nYour vows are only held under pain of sin if officially done in the Church. (There‚Äôs a way better way of explaining that) So, your private practices are not bound. \n\nAlso, you have a very strict obligation to fulfill your duties within your state in life. Those duties are just as important as your Catholic duties because they work hand-in-hand.  \n\nI believe a vow of poverty would prevent you from obtaining income. \n\nHere‚Äôs another point to make. Making a vow is not going to convince you to develop yourself fundamentally. You‚Äôre not going to ‚Äúall of a sudden‚Äù come to a spiritual realization or whatever. You need to develop yourself on a fundamental level, building up these virtues that you wish to make vows for and make them a part of your life first. This is why religious have years living as such before making vows. \n\nAs a layperson, all you need is what I described above.

Attempting to thwart Archbishop Lefebrve‚Äôs mission of forming priests and ensuring that mission continues long after his death is a mark against the men in Rome, not the SSPX.¬†"

Anglicans, RC and EO\n\nI have read a lot of Catholic literature, especially John Henry Newman, St Therese of Liseaux, St John of the Cross. And I have listened to a good few Catholic commentators eg. Trent Horn, Kennedy Hall, Fr Jenkins (SSPV), Tim Gordon etc. But I still struggle with a lot of Catholic doctrine and how it has developed, and a lot of YouTube commentators, both Protestant and Catholic, usually have bad faith arguments, or maybe just don't fully understand what the other believes - like the time Taylor Marshall said Martin Luther taught that sinning didn't matter, which isn't true.\n\nAnyway, I am rambling. I have a few questions which I'd appreciate any guidance on üôÇ\n\n1. Mary as Co-Redemptrix - I really don't understand this. It is a beautiful idea of Mary being the Mother of Christians, but the example texts in scripture such as John caring for Mary after Jesus' death and Mary telling the servants at the wedding to do what Jesus tells them; it just seems like a leap to go from that to Co-Redemptrix.\n\n2. Baptismal Regeneration - Henry Manning left the CoE and joined the RC over this matter. Again, I understand that baptism and salvation in scripture are closely linked but the thief on the cross did not have to be baptised. I understand the argument as to why Confession is not necessary for those in certain circumstances to be saved, but as people believe the infants will go to limbo if they are not baptised then it seems like adults also would not be able to enter heaven without it.\n\n3. The Church - One of Newman's arguments that the RC Church was the true Church was that it was unchanged, unlike the Anglicans, Lutherans, Presbyterians (which I wholly agree with) but after Vatican 2, doesn't this become an argument against the RC Church?\n\nAnyway, thank you for your time for reading and, if you do, answering üôÇ",

While most protestants adhere to *sola scriptura*, Scriptures only, no Tradition. Even scriptures were transmited to us through Tradition (from mouth to mouth first, then written, then unified in a single Bible putt together by the Church). Unlike Muslims who believe all truth is contained in the Quran, we believe that Tradition was transmitted partially orally, partially throught liturgy etc., AND with scriptures. ;)  \n2. \"as people believe the infants will go to limbo if they are not baptised then it seems like adults also would not be able to enter heaven without it.\" Well this is what Catholics do believe! Except for baptism of desire (a catechumen who dies willing to get baptism and in certain dispositions) and blood baptism (martyrdom of a cathecumen). Also Catholic theologians believe it's not impossible for an non Catholic baptized person to go to Heaven when he's in state of pure ignorance (for example a guy living in the Amazon forest and could never have heard of the Catholic church.)  \n3. Depends what you define as \"the Church\". Whatever the Pope says doesn't change what faith is. An important concept to use here is infallibility; a Pope is infallible only in very specific conditions; those conditions weren't met during Vatican II! There are examples in history of Popes preaching material heresy (like pope Liberius, Pope John XXII,...) but never when speaking infallibly. \n\nHave a good day, I won't be able to answer this weekend because I'll be doing the Chartres pilgrimage! üôÇ"

Mary as co redemptrix is getting at the fact that Mary played a role in the greater plan of our salvation through her cooperation as the new eve alongside the new Adam. \nThrough the disobedience of Adam and eve sin came into the world, Through the obedience of the new Adam and eve sin was destroyed. It's important to know that co DOES NOT mean equal to, it means along with, so mary of course is not God and did not save us from our sins in the same way Jesus does. Jesus telling John behold thy mother and telling Mary woman behold thy son is Jesus making Mary the mother of the church and he is referring  to her as woman to connect her to the woman in the prophesy from genises 3. This goes extremely in depth I recommend you check out William albrecht on anything regarding maryology. \n\n2. Baptismal regeneration is extremely abundant in the early church, and the thief on the cross is an examples of Baptism by desire. Water baptism is the ORDINARY means of Baptism, but there are EXTRAORDINARY means like Baptism of desire or Baptism of martyrdom. \n\n3. The church did not change in its dogmatic binding teachings, just because there is heresy in the church doesnt mean it fell, Jesus said it will never happen. look at the arian crisis, heresy spreads but it doesnt mean the gates of hell will prevail, evil attacking the church is nothing new, Jesus said it would happen and it has happened but it won't prevail."

        "body": "The first thing I would say is that one shouldn‚Äôt treat these questions separately as matters of opinion, but rather go to the root of things. We know that the Catholic Church is the true Church because God has revealed that to us. We know from philosophy that God can neither deceive nor be deceived, so if we receive a message from him, it must be true. We know that we as a race have received public revelation from God since he signed his messages with his signature, which consists of miracles and prophecies. This is what Faith is based on; Faith is the virtue by which we believe those things which God has revealed (so Faith is not some sort of blind trust as moderns say; it is based on evidence). This is the reason that Our Lord worked miracles, to prove that he came from God and that his teaching was true. The pagans and Jews of the early centuries even accepted this since they did not try to dispute that miracles were worked, but rather accused Our Lord of being a magician (there is evidence for this in the Talmud and Origen‚Äôs work ‚ÄòContra Celsum‚Äô in which he quotes Celsus). This cannot be true though since Our Lord both rose from the dead and raised others from the dead, which is something not possible by witchcraft. This relates to Catholicism not only because their is a continuity of doctrine and governance with the Church of the early centuries (for it is the same Church), but also because miracles have been worked as motives of credibility of the Catholic religion up until the present. Ss Francis Xavier and Anthony raised people from the dead, for example, and very many miracles have been recorded at Lourdes and examined in terms of natural science. St Pius X had miracles associated with him also, and all that is not to mention all the Eucharistic miracles and the miracle of the sun at Fatima. If you accept that argument, then you must submit to what the Catholic Church teaches, for God, who is omniscient and omnipotent, preserves Her from error.\n\nAs to your specific questions:\n1. Christ is the source of all graces, and since Christ was brought into the world by Mary, there is a sense in which She is the Mediatrix of all graces. It seems also that the idea is quite old with the Fathers of the Church calling Our Lady a ‚Äògo-between‚Äô. The Catholic teaching on this is discussed in Ludwig Ott‚Äôs Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma: https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsofca0000ottl/page/209/mode/1up?view=theater (You will need to make an account, but it doesn‚Äôt cost anything).\n2. It is Catholic dogma (it is divinely revealed) that baptism, or the desire of it when baptism is impossible, is mediately necessary for salvation (meaning you‚Äôre stuffed if you do not have one of those). See the Council of Trent‚Äôs teaching on baptism. However, one cannot desire something that one does not know, so I cannot see that applying to people who have not come into contact with Catholicism or have no intention of being baptised. The doctrine itself is clear, but exactly how the doctrine applies is disputed. St Thomas teaches that God will send either an angel or a missionary to a person who truly seeks the truth to instruct him in the truths of the Faith, and there were cases of this happening in the New World, and that is also what I hold. Some theologians after the discovery of the New World began speculating that someone could implicitly desire baptism, but I can only see this as rubbish for the reason already stated.\n3. Following the Second Vatican Council, the Catholic Church, prima facie, no longer appeared to fulfil Her own doctrine about Herself (unity of Faith, infallibility of Oecumenical Councils, dogma can never change, harmful laws or rites impossible for Her to promulgate due to Her disciplinary infallibility, infallible canonisations, etc.). However, it is hardly plausible, considering the Church‚Äôs bold claims about Herself, that the Church could fulfil Her claims about Herself for ~1,960 years and then cease to do so; that is preposterous from the point of view of human probability. These apparent contradictions also do not strike a death blow to the previous proofs mentioned using miracles and prophecies as motives of credibility. For some people, it is enough to end there, however, after much thinking and research, I have concluded that a vacancy of the Holy See is the solution to these difficulties; the apparent contradictions with the doctrines I listed above melt away if one concludes that these changes were not made by Catholic Popes, but rather by men who managed to give the impression to the world of belonging to and being leaders of the Catholic Church when they had in fact abandoned Her and could not therefore represent Her or act on Her behalf. There is superfluous evidence for the Popes from Paul VI onwards (from about 1964 at least) being heretics, and since heretics are not members of the Church, and one cannot be the head of a society without being a member of it, then they cannot be or have been visible heads of the Catholic Church. That is the short explanation, and there are difficulties that arise, but these can be explained if need be."

So, she did have a free will to not birth Jesus, but God also knew that she was going to agree to give birth to Jesus, because God knows all possible futures. Which is why she can be seen as a co-redemptrix because without her will (\"I am the Lord's servant\" aka \"I will serve\"), Jesus would not have happened. She did however, not redeem the world on Cavalry as Jesus did. The word \"co-redemptrix\" did not appear in the magisterium until the pontificate of Pius XII, and it's not a dogma to not believe in it. \n\n2. Infants in limbo is a theological debate. There are theories and visions that they are in hell but do not suffer any pain, they just cannot see God. Other theories say that God will give them perfect knowledge and then let their free will decide. It's up to God, really, trusting that he is all-just. Jesus is not bound by the sacraments himself and the thief on the cross had the baptism of desire (he couldn't physically get down from the cross to get baptized). We also celebrate the feast of the Holy Innocents, the first babies who were \"baptized by blood\", since they died for Jesus when Herodes killed them. Everyone SHOULD get baptized as soon as possible. But if it isn't physically possible, the desire would suffice. God not only knows what will happen, but he also knows what would happen if the circumstances were different. He knew that if the thief wasn't nailed to the cross, he would obey Jesus and get baptized."

Another user who has commented provided a link to a book, so I will read that and see I get on. I will keep in mind Catholic belief in revelation, tradition and scriptures. I suppose it does then raise the question: where do we get the doctrine to follow tradition and revelation?\n\nFrom what I understand, Anglicans believe in scripture and they interpret scripture through the lens of the Church Fathers. As Reformed protestants, we believe that it is a gathering of information and theology through the years and from there we understand what scripture says - I suppose this means that we didn't really know what scripture was saying for 1600 years though üòÇ\n\n2. Haha! Well, yes I suppose it is what Catholics believe but it doesn't sit well with me but that is my own issue, nothing much can be done about that. Thank you for explaining regarding the baptism of desire and martyrdom. I have heard Fr Jenkins of the SSPV speak about this, but I suppose I didn't quite get what was really meant about it.\n\n3.

        "body": "The miracles are worked by Catholics or occur in a Catholic context because God stamps Catholicism, and often certain doctrines of Catholicism, with his approval using them. If he did the same for Protestants, then he would appear to give approval to a false religion. So the fact that Catholics have miracles and Protestants don‚Äôt is proof that Catholicism is true and Protestantism is false. The miracles are still public knowledge and can be investigated by Protestants; that is the point of them, to serve as motives of credibility for everyone. I would also say that miracles do sometimes happen to non-Catholics (the examples I can currently think of are of Jews), but their nature was such that these people felt compelled to convert to Catholicism by them.\n\n2. The reason is in the very foundation of Christianity. We are all fallen because we have inherited original sin from our first parents. Original sin brought all sorts of evils into the world, but it also prevents us from spending eternity with God. I haven‚Äôt done the reading to understand the complexities of this, but I think we both know that this is undisputed by the Fathers of the Church etc. The easiest way to look at it is that the son of an alcoholic suffers from his father spending all his wages on drink rather than on food, clothing, and shelter for his son. The son does not deserve the consequences, but they are the natural result of the wickedness of his father.\n\n3. No, it does not. To be a Catholic, one must be baptised, publicly profess the Catholic Faith, be subject to the legitimate pastors, especially the Pope, and not have been excluded by legitimate authority. Those Anglo-Catholics do not publicly profess the Catholic Faith, nor would they submit to the Pope if they were convinced he were in fact the Pope as Sedevacantists would (even if we are wrong, we lack pertinacity from the fact that we would submit were we convinced that the current claimant actually held the office).\n\nYou‚Äôre very welcome for the answer!"

Your understanding is more accurate.\n\nStill, even in context, the quote is doctrinally objectionable, as Luther used it in support of his *sola fide* position. Here's the quote in context (in a letter to Melanchthon):\n\n>If you are a preacher of mercy, do not preach an imaginary but the true mercy. If the mercy is true, you must therefore bear the true, not an imaginary sin. God does not save those who are only imaginary sinners. Be a sinner, and let your sins be strong (or ‚ÄúSin boldly‚Äù),but let your trust in Christ be stronger, and rejoice in Christ who is the victor over sin, death, and the world. We will commit sins while we are here, for this life is not a place where justice resides. We, however, says Peter (2 Peter 3:13) are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth where justice will reign. **It suffices that through God‚Äôs glory we have recognized the Lamb who takes away the sin of the world. No sin can separate us from Him, even if we were to kill or commit adultery thousands of times each day.** Do you think such an exalted Lamb paid merely a small price with a meager sacrifice for our sins? Pray hard for you are quite a sinner.\n\nThe bolded portion of the above quote is where I see the doctrinal problem. Mortal sin does, in fact, separate us from God's sanctifying grace, because it is a knowing, deliberate rejection of that grace."

It's not a revelation of an arbitrary decree of God or man, but an understanding of and a description of the very nature of being, truth, love and all creation. It's like someone asked: Where did we get the doctrine to follow gravity so that things could start falling?\n\nThe difference between Catholicism and Protestantism is that Catholicism sees God as the foundation and source of everything, including the nature of everything, that exists. Protestantism sees God mainly as a lawgiver. Catholicism holds that the intellect of man, like that of angels, is created to behold spiritual things, up to and including God Himself, though not exhaustively. But according to Protestantism, man is only able to grasp God the same way one grasps the laws of his nation and his personal freedoms.\n\nTradition is self-authenticating by nature. When a Protestant reads for example about the Beatitudes, he can only grasp what is said as a phenomenon or an appearance, whereas a Catholic advanced enough is able to grasp the nature or the essence of what's being said. These are the real issues to be grappled with. Things such as papal infallibility or the Immaculate Conception will only begin to make sense in light of the correct foundation."

Loving God means obeying that knowledge, which at the same time literally means partaking of the Holy Ghost.\n\nIn a sense, people who love God above all will be at home in the universe, and secondarily possess a body and exist in a physical place. This is salvation or Heaven. Presence of God, not to the eyes or the senses but to the intellect. People who either dislike or hate or simply preferred to ignore God will be stuck with their choice, face to face with the knowledge that God is most important and most lovable and most true of all there is. And they will hate themselves and everything for this, which is the essence of Hell, which only secondarily means physical existence in a dark, fiery place with others that have chosen the same fate.\n\nAn unbaptized child can not enter Heaven. Not because someone decrees or ordains it so, but because of the very definition of what Heaven is. But neither will there be Hell for the child, because Hell is the punishing knowledge of having rejected God either directly or through something that represents God. So logically there will be neither glory nor suffering for such children.\n\nIf you really want to gain deep insight into the nature of these things, study Fr. Garrigou-Lagrange's writings. Then Summa Theologica. Then The Catholic Encyclopedia. Get the definitions straight, get the metaphysical foundation.

His whole family, including a Priest who is a cousin, are NO Catholics. (Priest is a diocesan Priest who prefers to say the TLM, but still occasionally says NO.) When I met my boyfriend, he told me he was only attending a TLM, not NO. I currently attend an independent TLM, and also like and have attended SSPX in the past. \n\nOver the past two weeks he was invited by an acquaintance who goes to his Church to attend a NO confirmation Mass on a Sunday. He ended up going to the wrong Church and ended up missing over half of the NO confirmation Mass by the time he arrived at the right Church. I found out later the same acquaintance gave him a NO missal. Last Sunday he went to a NO Mass because it was more convenient for him to see an old friend over an hour's drive away. I was not happy about this at all, and nor was my Priest and family.\n\nOnce a week my Priest will call him and give him lessons after weekly readings of the My Catholic Faith book. My boyfriend appreciated the lessons at first, and after I told my Priest about the recent attendance of NO, my Priest has been discussing with him the heresies of the NO. My boyfriend thinks he is Traditional Catholic and defends his decision to go to NO the past two weeks. My priest told him that if he does not start attending the TLM and admit the heresies of the NO and submit to being a Traditional Catholic, then I will not marry him, as it is not what I want. I have had several discussions with my boyfriend about why I agreed with my Priest. He then consulted his Priest cousin, as well as a cousin who attends a diocesan TLM exclusively. Boyfriend has told me he only wants to go to diocesan TLM in the future. He told me that he wants the \"Church\" (conciliar) and thinks that by not attending diocesan TLM, he is stepping away from the Church. He thinks NO is still reverent and valid. I asked him about attending SSPX, and he said he does not know anything about them. I told him that diocesan TLMs will eventually be wiped out, and if he loves the TLM so much, he will need to consider another option. I told him I would consider what he has told me before making a final decision.\n\nMy questions are as follows: Is it worth continuing the relationship? Or are we too incompatible? Should I not attend a diocesan TLM due to heresy, no Sacraments said in Latin Rite, etc.?",

While there is nothing wrong with the prayer theologically, it should NEVER be a replacement for a real rosary (which a lot of people apparently do to \"save time\"). That in itself is the deception.\n- Faustinas diary was on the list of banned (i.e prohibited) books for 50 years. That should make people question her relatively quick approval to sainthood. There are a lot of doubts around Sister Faustinas sainthood and general post-V2 beatifications. These issues are not due to translation errors as JPII claimed.\n- While the prayers are about Jesus' heart, the first Divine Mercy image does not show Jesus' wounds nor his heart, which is very, very unusual. The wounds were added in a later edition of the image. The image was banned in 1959, because of doubts about the theology of Divine Mercy.\n- Sister Faustinas visions theologically do not line up with what Jesus would say (such as claiming that Jesus would not judge her or that you could save people at the hour of their death through the chaplet, even though that includes people outside the Church)\n- I am sceptical towards the Divine Mercy Sunday due to the above reasons, since it reeks of protestant-ish \"Jesus will forgive me anyways\". I cannot judge whether the indulgence is valid or not, if in doubt I'd lean towards \"yes\".\n\nI would pick another classical devotion, such as the Brown Scapular, the St. Michael Chaplet, the St. Bridget chaplet the full rosary (all mysteries) before I'd pray the Divine Mercy chaplet."

Also, there  are sections of her diary where it sounded as though Jesus was putting Sr Faustina above His Mother. Just NO. Also, the portrait is off - where are Jesus' wounds? There are other things that seem off. It seems like a typical Modernist attempt to replace traditional devotions such as the Rosary and the Sacred Heart novena.\n\nMy SSPX pastor has spoken against it; he's said the prayers are fine, but the source and other things are questionable and that He will no longer bless DM items. I'd actually be disappointed if I saw a DM image in an SSPX chapel or another traditional church."

Nobody can formally declare the pope a heretic and excommunicate him because there is no higher authority on earth, except for a later pope. So popes can be declared heretics in retrospective, but not while they are in office (that would also undermine the office because the pope could've been declared heretic for many different minor reasons). \n\nThey can practice and preach heresy (as long as it's not ex cathedra, which the Holy Spirit would prevent), but that doesn't mean we should blindly follow that heresy. We should still use our brains. There were too-nationalistic popes, there were popes tempted by Arianism, there were lots of times in history when popes didn't act like they should and caused a scandal. However, you also have to take into account that the pope doesn't act alone and that Popes can change. There are massive lobbies and groups within the Church that would like to control the pope and prayer can change those people."

The Church would not be, for a moment, obliged to listen to him when he begins to teach a doctrine the Church knows to be a false doctrine, and he would cease to be Pope, being deposed by God Himself.\n\nIf the Pope, for instance, were to say that the belief in God is false, you would not be obliged to believe him, or if he were to deny the rest of the creed, ‚ÄúI believe in Christ,‚Äù etc. The supposition is injurious to the Holy Father in the very idea, but serves to show you the fullness with which the subject has been considered and the ample thought given to every possibility. If he denies any dogma of the Church held by every true believer, he is no more Pope than either you or I; and so in this respect the dogma of infallibility amounts to nothing as an article of temporal government or cover for heresy.\n\n(Abp.

I'd say there are 2 solutions, first try to tell her that the sacrament itself is much more important than whoever is the godfather, that your brother should pick the rite he loves the most, especially since the new rite is often invalid (just a few weeks I talked to a father who had to receive his confirmation again since he realized the bishop made a \"general confirmation\" instead of giving it individualy). You can also try to tell her that a sacrament is something one cannot receive against his will, he should be the one making the decision. And btw, for confirmation, the confirmed one is the one who choses his godfather anyway.\n\nIf that doesn't work, I'd say that this is a case where disobedience is necessary, but it'd be sad to have to go through this; try to convince her as much as you can.

Bad people don't change the faith, allegations need to be taken seriously and the people in question removed - but always with due process. The Vatican has barely disciplined priest for abuse, even in admitted cases. The key here is that it will not be solved by allowing priests to marry or women to read Mass.  \n\n>Fegan had unveiled what he called a ‚Äúgolden cage‚Äù or ‚Äúgilded prison‚Äù: Notre Dame de Montgardin, a secluded monastery in the Western Alps. ‚ÄúThis is the place where they hide priests who had been molesting children,‚Äù Fegan tells Stuff.  \n>  \n>Jake says the clergy‚Äôs handling of the Carlile case will reflect badly on the SSPX leadership. Sending Carlile to Notre-Dame de Montgardin instead of complaining to police, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just letting him off very easily‚Äù.\n\nThe priest molested a child and was sent to a monastery as a disciplinary measure. In this case, it happened in the sacristy, so nobody can prove what happened unless the priest himself admits to it and turns himself in. So, best thing they can do is send him away. Then the press attacks the SSPX for \"not doing enough\", like okay what should they do, execute him on the spot over an allegation?\n\n>The Rev. Laurent Ram√©, the superior of the SSPX priory of Saint-Germain-de-Prin√ßay in which Maillard resided, alerted the police in early summer 2020 after receiving reports of several rapes and sexual assaults.   \nShortly after the revelations in 2020, the Lefevbrists \"excluded\" Maillard from the priestly fraternity, according to Jorna. \n>The superior said the institute also filed a civil suit against Maillard. After the accusations, the priest was sent to the Maison Notre-Dame. Located in the Hautes-Alpes, near Gap, where they welcome priests from the SSPX, some of whom are accused of sexual assault. Shortly after his arrival, Maillard was indicted and then imprisoned.\n\nOkay, so he was detained, reported to the police and imprisoned as soon as SSPX authorities knew about rape accusations (the prior cases were reports of minor misdemeanors).  Doesn't really sound like a \"cover-up\" to me. In the other cases, the families knew about the abuse, but didn't alert any SSPX authorities, so why blame the SSPX leadership then? \n\n> Kneeling on the wooden prie-dieu, they believe their future lies in how strongly they hold onto their rosary beads. \n\nAgain, hyperbole like this is why I'm weary of such allegations. Because if you have an axe to grind people are going to just make stuff up. It just reveals that they want to smear the SSPX and make it seem as if the society does nothing."

That's my personal bias and I might be wrong. My assumption is that the SSPX is very aware of not ruining their reputation as they are already a minority, therefore they probably care more about avoiding such cases than the official Church.

The only way that I'm aware of getting the SSPX to start saying Mass closer to you is for you to put in the work of organizing the faithful in your local area to make it worth the SSPX's time to have a priest visit closer to you. You can certainly reach out to the closest SSPX priory and ask if they have any specific tips (maybe there's already a group of faithful in your area and they can let you know that).\n\nWhat would probably make the most sense is to move closer to an existing SSPX location. Obviously that's a difficult and multi-year process, but God is not outdone in generosity so you can be assured of recompense for your sacrifices. I think it's good to keep in mind that a value we haven't or at least aren't willing to suffer for is just an opinion. \n\nIt's not enough to just say that the Faith and the Sacraments are important to us, we must be able to point to concrete actions we have taken to demonstrate that the Faith and Sacraments are important to us. \n\nPersonally, if I ran the SSPX for a day, I would give a 5 year notice to any location with less than a hundred people (maybe even higher than that), and then close them down.

If you have to go to the NO to avoid a violent falling out just go but you can compromise with them that you won't participate or serve in any of the ceremonies. And if they try to force you somehow then you can talk to the priest or layperson in charge to tell them that you don't want to do it but you're being forced to. They would certainly not want you to do that \n\nConsider that, if you push this too hard on them, you might be burning an otherwise precious bridge that in the future - perhaps not so distant - will serve to also lead your parents to the True Latin Mass. Also, they probably think that you are just being teenage rebellious or that you have been brainwashed by this \"Trad cult\", and your handling of the situation might encourage this false notion in their minds.\n\nTry to be meek and humble at heart, like Our Lord Himself told us to be. You don't want this immense treasure to be a wedge betwen you and your parents but instead to be able to lead them to it and to share it with them. They most probably are only trying to protect you from what they perceive as a danger to your soul.\n\nYou can always offer up this humiliation and submission of your will in reparation for all the sacrileges and abuses that will be committed in this disgraceful ceremonies."

Maybe this was just a test, but as soon as the letter became public there was a lot of debates within the SSPX against this letter. Some priest openly criticized the SSPX and were expelled, some left by themselves, saying the SSPX was about to sign a compromising agreement with Rome. After all this turmoil the SSPX ended up not signing the agreement, but the evil was done. However, after seeing the SSPX backed down (and rightly so), \"resistance\" (most of them refuse the word) priests kept saying that the SSPX would sign the agreement, even if it still hasn't more than 10 years, and they started scrutinizing the SSPX and blaming it for any tiny thing, to justify their departure from the SSPX. \n\nSo what the SSPX priest I talked with a few years ago was basically \"resistance people were right to disagree with the letter (the priest told me he himself was very scared when he saw the letter); however, by condemning the SSPX before it actually signed any agreement, they lacked prudence. Also, we have to trust our superiors as much as we can because they know things we don't, so of course we shouldn't have blind obediance, but we shouldn't condemn them for something they haven't even done yet.\"  \n\nTo answer the example of Vatican II, that's what the resistance says, but as I said I think it's just a way to justify the separation since the SSPX ended up not signing anything compromising.\n\nAs someone who reads Archbishop Lefebvre a lot, I can tell that the SSPX has kept his very prudence and balanced position, consisting in criticizing the problematic parts of Vatican II whithout calling it formally heretic. \n\nMy Ecclesia Dei friends keep saying that the SSPX just talks about Vatican II, my resistance friends say the SSPX never talk about it... The common point between them is that they never go to the SSPX and just repeat what they've heard from their priests trying to justify their position!\n\nSo my conclusion is that when I have to chose between resistance and SSPX I always chose the SSPX, for a few other reasons too; also, I hate the spirit of \"war\" that we have, because it's a big scandal for people outside the Tradition; and I noticed the SSPX barely talks about the resistance, while the resistance keeps talking about the SSPX all the time."

So I think you should show up to the baptism, but not participate in any way (and if they notice, make sure to tell them it's not against them!)\n\nRegarding the baptism, the traditional doctrine of the Church was that it is better for a baby to not be baptized than to be baptized but not raised as a Catholic; if they won't take him to Mass every sunday, that'd be a good enough reason to refuse the baptism, for the child's sake. This sounsd cruel, but it's the right thing to do.\n\nRegarding your brother, I didn't get if he was practicing it or not?"

The second problem, is that for the church to officiate this baptism there should be a well-founded hope that the child would be brought up in the Catholic religion, and this does not seem to be the case. Under these circumstances, in any other time in history, the priest would refuse the baptism.\n\nMy reccomendation would be to inform the priest where the baptism is going to take place before it happens, so this can be corrected.

But this first point could depend a lot on the next point...\n\nSecond, about your brother and his living situation. Currently he's living in mortal sin and in public scandal and he would certainly not be allowed to be a Godfather by any means, doctrinally, canonically, or even common sense-wise. I know of several relatives and friends that were refused as Godparents in NO parishes because they were living in concubinage, adultery, etc. and your brother's situation, sadly, is even worse than that. Which makes me think that this NO parish is probably one of the worst kind (yeah, there are some worse than others), unless they somehow have been lied to or given incomplete information about the prospective Godfather. In any case, please do report it to the proper authority, anonymously if possible, and if they still go through with him after having all the facts then I would advise you to abstain from participating in that, clearly shameful and most probably sacrilegious travesty.\n\nIn any case, try to ask your local SSPX priest's advice on this giving him all the necessary information; that's always the best course of action.\n\nAnd pray a lot for your siblings (which I know you most certainly do already), I will remember all of you in my prayers."

Neither he nor his ex-wife are baptized, so had a valid natural marriage. I am also unbaptized. Because of all this, the dissolution of his previous marriage has to go to the Vatican. We are catechumens who recently had the bomb dropped on us that the dissolution will not be completed in time for us to receive Sacraments at Easter, despite being assured since September that it would be done in time and everything was on track.\n\nAt this point we have given up hope that there is any way we will be receiving Sacraments this Easter, we are \\*extremely\\* frustrated and disheartened. We did faith formation several years ago at an FSSP church and were made to believe the process would be fairly simple and straightforward, the exact opposite of what we are going through at our current diocesan parish. I know SSPX is in irregular communion with Rome, so I am curious how the dissolution of marriage process might work. Would it still need to go through the diocesan tribunal process and to the Vatican? Or is there a different process entirely?\n\nThank you in advance for any information you can give! ",

And I don't think it's possible to argue we're out, otherwise it'd mean Pope Francis allowed schismatics to give confession and marriage!\n\nNow to answer your question, except in France where an agreement has been made, the SSPX doesn't want to follow the current canon law regarding marriage (because of its views that are against Tradition) and so it has set up its a community tribunal, which doesn't go through diocesan. \n\nAnyway, if you have other questions let me know, if you want I'm in touch with SSPX priests so I can them directly, you both will be in my prayers!"

However, I wouldn't be surprised if the SSPX ends up telling you the same thing your diocesan parish (at least in the timeline). In any case, this is a very technical issue with a lot of moving parts, your best bet is to either contact the SSPX US District Office or get in touch with your local SSPX priest.  \n\n\nYou also might be able to get some sort of workaround if you're dead set on getting sacraments at Easter, it would probably involve the two of you taking a public vow to live as brother and sister until the two of you can be validly married in the Church. That way the two of you can get Baptized and receive the Eucharist (and possibly Confirmation), and once the marriage stuff is sorted out, you two can get that taken care of at a later date."

But you know what ? My father works with Don David Pagliarani, and when Don David heard about that, he was really angered and the priest was lectured and is not head of priory anymore.\n\nSincerely, US SSPX churches are really one of a kind, don't judge SSPX only by them, they don't lead SSPX, and their modus operandi is not at all majoritary in SSPX.\n\nFor the full communion and cooperation with diocese thing...

In addition, it is not cult-like since the sspx only does what the church has always done; that which is not harmful to the faith. They do not innovate nor deviate from tradition or orthodoxy. You claim that one should seek a conservative NO priest which is already almost a contradiction. I've met good NO priests but they are the distant minority in what should almost never be the case. The fact you have to qualify a \"conservative\" priest is telling of the dangers of NO parishes. Going to mass and seeking counsel should not be a gamble, hence the disapprobation of NO masses.

If you want to spend hours in prayer (a very laudable desire to be sure), then you should drop out of school and join a religious order. You must fulfill your duties of state, which as a student means focusing on your studies. Perhaps your education is a little different from mine but I don't see how someone could do well in school while also spending hours a day in prayer (which again in isolation is not a bad thing, but when it impedes your ability to fulfill your duties of state then it does become a bad thing). \n\nA remedy I've heard for scrupulosity when it comes to prayer is to resolve never to repeat a prayer. Say your rosary, and if it's not perfect so be it, offer up the imperfection to God. Most of the time scrupulosity is simply just our pride telling us that we can actually save our souls on our own, it's not the Grace of God that saves us. \n\nI recommend you read through the very short book (practically a pamphlet) [Can We Be Saints?](https://www.arlingtonregia.com/legionsaints/cwbs.html) by Frank Duffey. An excellent quote from the book:\n\n>Perhaps the following words of Cardinal Newman will tempt us to take a step forward on the road:  \n\"If you ask me what you are to do in order to be perfect, I say, first do not lie in bed beyond the time of rising; give your first thoughts to God; make a good visit to the Blessed Sacrament; say the Angelus devoutly; eat and drink to God's glory; say the Rosary well; be recollected; keep out bad thoughts; make your evening meditation well; examine yourself daily; go to bed in good time, and you are already perfect.\"\n\nAlso as u/Allstars94 mentioned, getting spiritual direction from a traditional priest is going to be your best bet as well. An in person meeting is better, but I'm sure if you get in touch with your local SSPX chapel they should be able to get an email address of a priest you can chat with."

Prayer is a good thing, and your unreasonable (personal, subjective) standards are turning it into a bad thing for you. \n\nYou definitely should talk to a priest about this. Even if he's not the best priest in the world, it's an exercise in humility and obedience to follow his direction. \n\nEvery virtue is a middle point between two extremes (an excess and a defect). Life is about aiming for that middle point (which is actually closer to one of the extremes, so it's not exactly in the middle); sometimes you find yourself on the defective side of things, sometimes you're on the excessive side. You're clearly on the excessive side of things.\n\nI'm not advocating that you give up religion entirely and lapse into being a mediocre Catholic, just that you take 10-15% off the top and steer towards the defective side of things. \n\nIt might help to think of this as you're trying to walk on the ridgeline of the roof of a good prayer life (walking perfectly on the ridgeline is having a perfect prayer life) . On the excessive side of the ridgeline, you fall off the roof by praying too much. On the defective side of things, you fall off the roof by praying too litte. I'm not encouraging you to pray too little, I'm encouraging you to take a step towards the defective side of things because you're clearly on the excessive side the ridgeline and in danger of falling off the roof entirely. \n\nI think you should go for a week or two of saying the most basic and simple prayers (no more than 5 min) for your morning and evening prayers.

I go to a little mission chapel who sends a priest over every Sunday and Holy Day from a priory in a different state.\nAnd yes, they are to be referred to as chapels and priories. My understanding is ‚Äúparish‚Äù is to only be used for diocesan churches. But someone can correct me on that if I am wrong. And there is still deference for what a local ordinary (bishop) in the diocese for which your church is within says for matters they have the right to change (sorry if that was a weird sentence-I am really tired). For example, in the US if a Holy Day falls on a Saturday or Monday, the you are usually exempt from the obligation under pain of sin (except Christmas-that never transfers). However, your chapel will likely highly encourage the faithful to still attend. Same for Ember Days and vigils that are traditional days of fasting that are no longer observed in Novus Ordo churches. But again, not under pain of sin. I was confused about that for a bit, which is why I bring it up. They recognize there are disciplines which the bishops and the pope have the authority to change, but whether or not it‚Äôs spiritually fruitful is another matter."

I try to make a point of spending at least 15 minutes in prayer every day. My general prayers usually consist of three parts: my general prayers where I just kind of talk to God as I mentioned, one part where I pray thanksgiving as well as for other around the world, and some other more structured prayers that I pray on behalf of myself and others \n\nUsually I‚Äôll pray the last two together and sometimes I‚Äôll just talk to God a bit earlier which I was able to do last night\n\nHowever last night I spent a lot more time doing some work than I had thought, didn‚Äôt eat until around 3:00-4:00 in the morning and as I was trying to prayer before eating it was taking me a lot longer than usual to get through it because of OCD and scrupulosity, and even after I ate I didn‚Äôt feel too great. \n\nIt can take me a long time to get through the other parts of my general prayers as well, especially if I‚Äôm really tired and I just ended up feeling like I should just get some sleep since 8 hours is very rare for these days and  just went to sleep \n\nThere‚Äôs only been one other time where I‚Äôve ended up skipping my nightly prayers was a week or two ago when I ended up taking some anxiety medication that I assume kinda ended up knocking me out pretty good. I ended up making up those prayers the next day which I plan on doing today, I already did the first part and might get  to the second part later today\n\nStill I woke up this morning feeling guilty because I decided to just not do the prayers I do every night kinda just because I didn‚Äôt feel like it, even if a couple of reasons may have been valid to an extent. Maybe I‚Äôm being scrupulous again but I feel like I committed mortal sin by neglecting to do what I know to be the right thing do in regards to prayer. Especially with prayer I do others\n\nJames 4:17\n\n\nTLDR: I‚Äôve been ving a lot of trouble with prayer recently and I neglected to do some of the prayers I do every night because I didn‚Äôt feel to great, is this mortal sin or not?",

Remember sin becomes mortal if it checks these three boxes. (1) grave matter (2) full knowledge, and (3) deliberate consent. It doesn't sound like you're purposefully avoiding prayer. It sounds like you're not in the best place right now. Highly recommend talking to your priest. Discipline is required for prayer and often times demons pull us away.

Then as you go about your day you‚Äôll be reminded and can pray a short prayer.  When you shower, you pray the morning offering prayer taped in the shower.  When you are sitting on the toilet you pick up the card on the counter and pray that prayer.  When you go to bed you have a card to read a prayer to your guardian angel.  It may not always be the most reverent but your trying and accomplishing small prayers throughout the day.  You will gain graces to help you expand and continue the short prayers.  Work your way back up to the rosary.\n\nI have to admit that when my children were little, and as a stay at home mom, I said a lot of prayers when I had to go to the bathroom.  It was the some of the only times I had relative quiet without someone tugging on my skirt (even if only a minute or two).

The objections are rarely that the teachings are untrue *per se*.\n\nIs that accurate, more or less?

Have faith that you're on the good path and remember that God rewards those who try their hardest to find the truth, to worship Him correctly. Remember that the path to Heaven is narrow - very, very narrow. Although, there's no reason to despair. We have the saints, angels, Mary, and Christ on our side. IMO, it's better to go to the sspx priest for your spiritual problems instead of the internet. They are typically very responsive and incredibly helpful. Ask for his number and develop a relationship with him. Also, diocesan priests, even the traditional ones, can vary wildly from one priest to another, whereas most if not all sspx priests are orthodox, just, wise, and charitable in their offerings.

I am still in Hanoi, Vietnam and there is a local parish with an English-speaking priest. \n\nI want to return to the Church, but I just don't know where to go. I have concerns about today's Church, so I'm hesitant to go to my local diocese. Prior to moving to Hanoi, I did attend Mass at a couple of independent parishes (one in northern Virginia and the SSPX in Richmond, VA) because I had concerns about the state of the Church. I never took the Sacraments at these churches and I always attended \"regular\" Mass before or after to fulfill my Sunday obligation. Now, I think that I am comfortable with rejoining the Church through the SSPX, but I was wondering the following:\n\n* If I go to Confession with an SSPX priest, when I return to Hanoi, should I attend Mass at the local diocesan parish? It's pretty modern (it's an international community, so lot's of singing, holding hands etc.). \n* I have a passing knowledge of the justifications for attending the SSPX, but any help in finding resources to read would be appreciated.\n\nAlso, I will be staying in Times Square for an upcoming business trip (February 8-11). I see that I am one block away from St. Christopher's Mission. But, due to my work and travel schedule, I will not be able to attend Mass Sunday evening: I can only go to Confession. Since I am returning to the Church after a few years, and I have a lot to confess (some things that I am very afraid of confession), should I contact the priest ahead of time to schedule Confession outside of normal hours? \n\nLastly, does anyone know if the priest has an email address? Calling is difficult because of the time differences. \n\nThank you in advance for your help and please pray for me. ",

If you are eligible for confession, thank God. but he may lay out stipulations for returning to the RCC since you were in schism or apostasy. I've heard things that a period of time and whatnot is needed to 'abjure' your schism, etc. but only a well-formed priest can get to the bottom of this for you and Fr Sulzen is fantastic even for SSPX.  \n\n\n  \n\"should I attend Mass at the local diocesan parish?

I think it comes down to the fact that they don't like us because we chose to defy and continue the original ways pre Vatican so they distort and confuse the issue so the wider popularion becomes scared of what the SSPX is because all they hear is \"defiance\"!\n\nThe politics belong to the people who study Theology. We understand what is wrong or right based on the traditional ways. Full communion with Rome? Did Jesus really care about the politics of who was who and what was what. No, he taught in a way that people would understand in that time and provided them the means to salvation.\n\nThe only reason these politics are there is to provide the means to teach people as the generations continue the ways of God and the laws he has shown. The Holy Mother Church has provided religious leaders to look after the structure and if they fault and fail to retain the traditional system, God is still the higher power. No man on earth has the authority to overwrite what God has shown men.\n\nAll this Communion and apparent defiance of Rome in previous years is just garbage and the only reason you read those sort of things is because the modernists and enlightened want to destroy one of the only true traditional society's left. They can't stand to live their lives knowing that we want Tradition and a way of Religion that God has provided and they haven't had a say in. Similar to history and the division of Church from State.\n\nGod loves us as children, we get told the ways and understand the consequences of our actions for not obeying him. Faith, Hope, Charity, love of God and our Neighbour, respect for the religion and its ways. That is the heart of the matter which no politics should ever tear away and which no man on earth can tear away."

I recommend you study the writings of Dr Peter Kwasniewski and of Dr John Joy (especially his articles at OnePeterFive).\n\nTo put it shortly, obedience to the pope is obviously not absolute. The pope is not above God (and His law), nor above Tradition.\n\nTo still answer your question though, I would say that such saints are rare as popes have mostly been orthodox (albeit sinful and ar times even corrupt, sometimes even scandalously so) and their supremacy was not questioned as people were used to absolute monarchs and the topic of the limits of obedience to the pope was simply not relevant (unlike today!).\n\nOf course there are examples of resistance to the pope, even in Holy Scripture with St. Paul resisting St. Peter to his face. You already mentioned St. Catherine of Siena. There are also canonised saints who backed anti-popes like St. Vincent Ferrer. I would say that Marcel Lefebvre should (and will) be canonised, also as patron saint of just resistance to superiors. Also, keep in mind that Cardinal Slipyj consecrated bishops against the will of the pope just like Lefebvre. He is not a canonised saint, but unlike the SSPX, he was undisputedly in good standing with the Church."

Lefebvre didn't cause a schism because he never set up competing jurisdictions or rejected the pope, and yes it is an excuse for illicit consecrations when Lefebvre had genuine concerns that people's faith were in danger, which according to canon law you cannot be excommunicated for. I agree it is never necessary to break communion with the church, I think we're we disagree is that I don't think he did. He made it very clear he is not creating a schism, the sspx still make it clear to this day which is why they don't give bishops jurisdiction. What he did was disobedient but not schismatic.\nI agree it created some sort of tension between the society and rome which is unfortunate but consecration of bishops is not a schismatic act, it just simply isn't."

Many bishops into the 1900s were consecrated without prior papal mandate, because of the difficulty of communication between Rome and certain overseas countries, the USA being one. In those days in order for a consecration to be in communion with Rome, the pontiff‚Äôs name would simply need to be mentioned in the Canon of the Mass. The consecration would eventually be recognized by papal authority sometime after the actual ceremony. Also hence the absurd amount of auxiliary bishops in the US and elsewhere.\n\nYes, Rome was ‚Äúworking‚Äù with ML‚Ä¶but to hear both sides of the account, it seems very understandable that ML and the rest of the SSPX were skeptical. This process of waiting took nearly a decade and Rome refused to move on the subject. ML knew his death was coming, so made the decision to move forward with the consecration, which legitimately saved the work of the SSPX and by extension saved the traditional liturgy all around the world. Even the FSSP owes its existence to this act.\n\nIf you want validation that Rome wasn‚Äôt going to move, find me a member of the FSSP who has been consecrated a bishop to provide for the needs of that community, even after years of requests, Rome has refused to allow such a consecration.\n\nIt‚Äôs worthy of note, that just like in centuries past, after the initial excommunication was lifted, all four bishops were recognized by Rome. \n\nWilliamson is a different issue who has since gone rogue from the SSPX."

The wife's responsibility/prerogative is in the domestic sphere. She looks after the children, cooks, cleans, does various other household chores, and makes the house a pleasant place to be. She acts as the heart of the home. Practically speaking, it is also not possible for a woman to have a full-time job outside of the home since, in a Catholic family in which everything is functioning as it should, the wife will often be pregnant and will be having to care for small children. It is not at all acceptable for other people to be regularly paid to look after the children so that the wife can go to work. Sending children to nurseries from a young age distresses the child and is also against the motherly instinct, and that for good reason.\n\nPius XI teaches in *Quadragesimo Anno* that it is immoral for women and children to be required to work. See paragraph 71:\n\n>71. In the first place, the worker must be paid a wage sufficient to support him and his family.\\[46\\] That the rest of the family should also contribute to the common support, according to the capacity of each, is certainly right, as can be observed especially in the families of farmers, but also in the families of many craftsmen and small shopkeepers. But to abuse the years of childhood and the limited strength of women is grossly wrong. Mothers, concentrating on household duties, should work primarily in the home or in its immediate vicinity. It is an intolerable abuse, and to be abolished at all cost, for mothers on account of the father's low wage to be forced to engage in gainful occupations outside the home to the neglect of their proper cares and duties, especially the training of children. Every effort must therefore be made that fathers of families receive a wage large enough to meet ordinary family needs adequately. But if this cannot always be done under existing circumstances, social justice demands that changes be introduced as soon as possible whereby such a wage will be assured to every adult workingman. It will not be out of place here to render merited praise to all, who with a wise and useful purpose, have tried and tested various ways of adjusting the pay for work to family burdens in such a way that, as these increase, the former may be raised and indeed, if the contingency arises, there may be enough to meet extraordinary needs.\n\nThis is not to say that there are not exceptions to this, for example, if the husband has died or is not fulfilling his responsibilities. However, this is not at all the ideal and there is a reason that charity to widows and orphans is regarded as of particular importance. It also does not mean that it is wrong for a wife to make a little money on the side, for example, with a small sewing business, and this sort of practice is praised in the wisdom literature of the Bible.\n\nAs to a single woman, there is nothing wrong with her working outside of the home so long as it is in accordance with her femininity. However, I do believe that it should be viewed as a temporary arrangement until she is either married or has entered the religious life, and I also believe that part-time work should be preferred following the same kind of thinking. A woman looking for a 'career' is misguided, for the point of a job is to either support only oneself (hopefully a temporary condition) or one's family. Since it is the man's responsibility to provide for the basic necessities of life, it naturally falls to him  to have jobs/'careers'. However, I will add that 'careers' seem to be viewed nowadays through the lens of self-aggrandisement rather than that of raising a family, and as such I dislike the word."

This means that they don't need the parents to go to work for someone else.\nIt's all in the holy Name of God and it's how God puts leading families together.\nThis is the ideal.\nToday, 2024, the Socialist politics everywhere encourages each person to go out of the house every day to work for the gov or for another family.

Catholicism did away with the treatment of wives as property, as was common in the ancient pagan world. Pope Leo XIII strongly condemned the pagan treatment of women in *Arcanum Divinis,* paragraph 7:\n\n>When the licentiousness of a husband thus showed itself, nothing could be more piteous than the wife, sunk so low as to be all but reckoned as a means for the gratification of passion, or for the production of offspring. Without any feeling of shame, marriageable girls were bought and sold, like so much merchandise,(5) and power was sometimes given to the father and to the husband to inflict capital punishment on the wife. Of necessity, the offspring of such marriages as these were either reckoned among the stock in trade of the common-wealth or held to be the property of the father of the family;(6) and the law permitted him to make and unmake the marriages of his children at his mere will, and even to exercise against them the monstrous power of life and death.\n\n[https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf\\_l-xiii\\_enc\\_10021880\\_arcanum.html](https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_10021880_arcanum.html)\n\nAs did Pius XI in *Casti Connubii,* paragraph 75:\n\n>75. This, however, is not the true emancipation of woman, nor that rational and exalted liberty which belongs to the noble office of a Christian woman and wife; it is rather the debasing of the womanly character and the dignity of motherhood, and indeed of the whole family, as a result of which the husband suffers the loss of his wife, the children of their mother, and the home and the whole family of an ever watchful guardian. More than this, this false liberty and unnatural equality with the husband is to the detriment of the woman herself, **for if the woman descends from her truly regal throne to which she has been raised within the walls of the home by means of the Gospel, she will soon be reduced to the old state of slavery (if not in appearance, certainly in reality) and become as amongst the pagans the mere instrument of man.**\n\n[https://www.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf\\_p-xi\\_enc\\_19301231\\_casti-connubii.html](https://www.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19301231_casti-connubii.html) \n\nBut, of course, I doubt you're interested in this.

Marriage is a contract/partnership by which a man and a woman agree to share their life and raise children together; it is an unequal friendship. It is a friendship because the two parties have the common goal of getting to heaven, raising children, and living happily together. It is unequal because someone must have the final say in the family; it is not possible to have a majority in a democracy of two, and God has ordained through the natural law that it is the man who will be the head of the family. This was recognised by every human society until ours.\n\nThere is a sense in which men and women are equal, in that God created them for the same purpose of loving him and in that they have similar rights that come along with their common obligations. They are not equal in physical strength, inclinations, abilities (a man cannot give birth, obviously), or in the majority of their responsibilities which are determined by their differing strengths and weaknesses, nor are they equal in authority when speaking in terms of a particular married couple.\n\nYour comparison with slavery falls apart at the first hurdle as slaves are property which can be bought and sold, yet we have already determined that wives are not property."

As I said earlier, slavery is the ownership of a person. Wives cannot be bought or sold, husbands are commanded to love their wives \"as Christ loved the Church\" (in case you didn't know, he was crucified for the Church), and the right of a husband to command his wife is not absolute as in chattel slavery. There are so many ways in which the noble institution of marriage differs from slavery that it is absurd that you even suggested this.\n\n>Hey, here‚Äôs a novel idea. How about marriages as an actual partnership based around compromise and genuine equality?\n\nThat is not what God has ordained, not in the absolute sense that you propose (of course there is compromise in marriage, but not in everything), nor does it work in practice most of the time. Many men nowadays allow themselves to become subject to their wives in their marriages; lacking a common rule concerning who makes the final decisions, it comes down to force of personality. Not to mention that the inequality is built into our nature.\n\n>Your arguments are no different than those made by antebellum slavers, who also claimed that God created a natural order where black people were subservient to whites.\n\nI simply answer that it is not part of the natural law that Africans be subject to Europeans as it is that, in a marriage, a wife owes obedience to her husband. This owed obedience was recognised in every human society that I know of throughout history, which is obviously not the case with regard to Africans and Europeans. I can also simply reply that, if you are correct concerning the arguments of these slavers, they were mistaken concerning the state of the natural order. It is not taught by the Catholic Church, preserved from error by God and marked by him as the true religion with miracles and prophecies, that obedience is indiscriminately owed by Africans to Europeans. However, it is taught by the Catholic Church that wives must obey their husbands.\n\n>It‚Äôs awfully convenient how much God wanted white men to stay in positions of power and authority, isn‚Äôt it?\n\nNow this is just a stupid thing to say, and another attempt to turn the argument back to emotional and rhetorical devices. An African man with a European wife, or a Chinaman with a Mayan wife, or a Mongol with a Mauritian wife, would have just as much authority over his wife as a European man over his European wife would.

From a quick look on Wikipedia, it seems hearsay refers to second-hand statements. For example, a witness repeats something which they heard from someone else. The statements of Justinian I and various of the others would therefore would not be classed as hearsay since they state that they witnessed these men with no tongues speaking with their own eyes. For example, Justinian says \"*Vidimus venerabiles viros , qui abscissis radicitus linguis suas p≈ìnas miserabiliter loquebantur\",* which translates as \"**We saw** venerable men, who, their tongues torn out from the root, were miserably relating their punishments\".

By your own logic, you should. Though I await your loophole anxiously.\n\nAs to the age of marriage morally allowable, I direct you to canons 1067 and 1034 of the 1917 Code of Canon Law. If you object to these, then you must also object to the law in Colombia and the law as it was in Scotland until 1929, less than a century ago. The age of consent in very many European countries also remains between 14 and 16."

Every person has this sense.\n\nWhen there are difficult moral questions, there tends to be a lot of disagreement and differing opinions. However, with more fundamental questions (such as whether murder is wrong, for example), there is a consensus. If there is a consensus throughout most of history and most societies, to the point that they hold exactly the same position, then it must be concluded that mankind has reached the truth. This is because there are very many ways of being wrong, but only one way of being correct. It seems incredibly unlikely that everyone would independently come to a consensus which were wrong, for probability is against every society following the same error, there being so many errors.\n\nSo, you see, it is not an appeal to the people, but rather an appeal to the fact that it would be very unlikely for everyone to be wrong in the same way independently."

For if Our Lord had sent them, it would have been either mediately or immediately. We say mission is given mediately when we are sent by one who has from God the power of sending, according to the order which He has appointed in His Church; and such was the mission of S. Dennis into France by Clement and of Timothy by S. Paul. **Immediate mission is when God Himself commands and gives a charge, without the interposition of the ordinary authority which He has placed in the prelates and pastors of the Church:** as S. Peter and the Apostles were sent, receiving from Our Lord‚Äôs own mouth this commandment: \\*Go ye into the whole world, and preach the Gospel to every creature\\* (Mark xvi. 15); and as Moses received his mission to Pharaoh and to the people of Israel. But neither in the one nor in the other way have your ministers any mission. How then have they undertaken to preach? \\*How shall they preach,\\* says the Apostle, \\*unless they be sent?\\*(Rom. x. 15)\n\nRatzinger\n\n>the place of prophecy is eminently the place God reserves for Himself to intervene personally and anew each time, taking the initiative.   \n>  \n>\"Ratzinger, \"Das Problem der Christlichen Prophetie,\" 181.

We are bound by the authority and teaching of all Popes. The difference obviously being that the current Pope has a duty and obligation to clarify and teach here and now.\n\nWe also have a duty and obligation to reject heresy and sin. The Pope like all men has free will and he can err and sin like any of us. Papal infallibility refers to the infallibility of the Pope when he is speaking as the Pope.  A Papal decree is different than simply addressing the general public or publishing a document for that reason.\n\nThe recent confusion and error largely arises from misunderstanding what level of authority given documents and teachings hold. Teachings that are not binding, but also ambigious have been used to introduce confusion into what is being practiced and taught.\n\nVatican II was pastoral it was not dogmatic. It is not infallible or binding. The Council of Trent by contrast was an ecumenical council and so any teachings on faith or morals are binding. The following is from the Council of Trent:\n\nCANON XIII.-If any one saith, that the received and approved rites of the Catholic Church, wont to be used in the solemn administration of the sacraments, may be contemned, or without sin be omitted at pleasure by the ministers, or be changed, by every pastor of the churches, into other new ones; let him be anathema.\n\nThis teaching tells us that it is anethema to compel ministers from practicing approved rites. Archbishop Lefebvre was improperly excommunicated for continuing to practice the Tridentine Rite, which was protected by the Council of Trent as I just quoted.\n\nSecond edit: I am a recent convert so anyone who sees a mistake with what I said please correct me."

The SSPX is not without its failures over its relatively short life, however its members have done a remarkable job in staying on the path Archbishop Lefebvre set them on. \n\nThe SSPX's disobedience **could** be the thin edge of a protestant wedge, but so far they have done nothing in the past 53 years to indicate that it is so (why haven't they engaged in more extreme behavior?).

The Church is where we belong and everyone should feel welcome.\n\nI would like to try to clarify what we are talking about though.\n\nDivorce does not exist in the Catholic Church.\n\nThere is seperation, which can be justified in the case of abuse. Sometimes during seperation a civil divorce is necessary (I believe it is necessary to seek approval first), but a civil divorce is only a divorce on paper. The marriage still remains intact.\n\nThere is annulment, which is the recognition that the marriage wasn't completed properly and for that reason it is invalid. (Annulments are given out in some diocese like secular \"divorces\" and this is an abuse of authority. There is a high standard that should be met to prove that the marriage didn't happen.)\n\nIn terms of dealing with judgement though that is another matter. It is going to be difficult, but as Catholics we try not to shy away from that which is hard. I would ask God for grace and try to forgive those who have wounded you. Try not to presume that everyone is walking around thinking about you ‚Äìbecause they aren't.

Since the SSPX doesn't typically circulate the actual ordained Deacons and Subdeacons around the mass centers/\"parishes\" (they typically stay at the Seminary when not on vacation or some sort of sabbatical), those positions at a SHM must be filled by priests. So for a Sunday Mass to be Solemn High you would need to tie up 3 priests for the entire Mass (and don't forget those priests also wouldn't be able to assist with distributing Communion, so you'd have to get more priests to assist with distribution).\n\nPeople seem to think that St. Marys has 11 priests lounging about while the 12th says Mass on Sunday, but most of them are gone on the weekends supporting mission chapels. The ones that aren't aren't have more than their fair share of work to do as they're likely teachers at the Academy and professors at the College, not to mention they are Spiritual Directors and also must tend to their diriges. Don't forget there's lots of Confessions to be heard! If there's 4,000 faithful in SM, that's 1 priest for every 333 faithful. Most other SSPX Priories have much smaller priest:faithful ratios, personally I think the ideal would be no more than 1:150."

Is an excellent and prompt cook. Devoted to making exquisite meals and desserts for her husband ( me!). Chicken a la king, beef Bourgogne, and T bone steaks are acceptable dishes. Bananas Foster and Black Forest cake are acceptable desserts. Of course, beyond the basics Mrs. can feel free to experiment in the kitchen.\n\n2. A dutiful housekeeper. You heard me! When I come home from a long days work I want the house looking spick and span. I may permit a maid being hired on occasion but she needs to make keeping things clean a priority.\n\n\n3. One who is Knowledgable about history and catholic culture. One who cares about being part of Christ‚Äôs church on earth and is familiar with catholic literature and music. Being familiar with both Gregorian and Byzantine chant are ideal, as well as the songs of the troubadours. Beowulf, Dante‚Äôs inferno, and the Canterbury tales are a must in terms of literary knowledge.\n\n4. A pleasing disposition! I need a wife who offers her petty inconveniences to the lord, and doesn‚Äôt waste time grumbling, muttering or criticizing the king of the castle ( me again!) I need her to have a godly disposition and never utter and unkind word.\n\n5. One who is spiritually curious. Who loves reading the old , new testaments and the catechism ( Baltimore and St Pius X most preferable.)\n\nSo I have my lists of ‚Äú musts.‚Äù I‚Äôve been fishing around on CatholicMatch.com and novus ordo parishes.

Married him at 21 and now I‚Äôm 22 with our first son. Saved my virginity for marriage. I never learned how to cook (because I was poor) until I married him and he did not mind at all. He loves what I cook and if I fail, he loves the effort anyway. He‚Äôs a real man and takes care of me and is very sweet. His duties are equal if not more than my own. I love living out God's perfect design. These things listed should probably not be said to a potential wife unless you want to scare her off (LOL), but, if she chose you and is willing to live out biblical womanhood, these duties are implied. You also have to be a very Christlike husband to motivate her to do her duties. I serve him even when he doesn‚Äôt deserve it and vice versa. \n\nLove is a choice. I chose him. He is my best friend and I'd never treat him badly. And because I try to keep a forgiving and supportive spirit (instead of belittling him), he has beaten his corn addiction that he's had since 13. I've never been happier for him. Men will change for God with a determined helpmate/helpmeet and a lot of prayer. \n\nThis is the list in which I recommend any traditional Catholic woman to look for in a man that is ready for marriage.\n\n1. Loves God with all his heart, defends His honor, prays, and lives by His commandments.\n\n2. Is 100% pro-life.\n\n3. Does not have a porn, nicotine, or alcohol addiction (you need to ask BEFORE deciding to court him).\n\n4. Honors his mother and father.\n\n5. Respectful, patient, humble, and assertive when needed.\n\n6. Hardworking, sacrificial, and is willing to provide for a family.\n\n7. Receives the sacraments.\n\n8. Chaste and protects your virginity until marriage.\n\n9. Confident in his masculinity.\n\n10. Desires fatherhood.\n\nThese are only some of the points that are important to look for early on; otherwise, you will be in for a difficult time trying to navigate healing during your marriage. Catholicism is not for the weak, which is why this world encourages a self-serving lifestyle. Those deceived by it may never see the face of Jesus. A good, Catholic marriage invites graces that will help you and your spouse make it to heaven together, with little distraction from the outside world. Choose wisely who you will love."

We don't primarily attend Mass because of what we get out of it, but mostly because God has demanded that we do so. \n\nIt is enough for her to tell God that she simply doesn't understand what's going on, but she is remaining faithful to His wishes by attending the sacrifice at which Catholics are all bound to attend on all Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation. Her heart doesn't necessarily need to be in the Mass (by which I mean she doesn't need to feel like her heart is in the Mass), for her to fulfill her obligations. \n\nOf course, it helps a whole lot if we do attempt to gain a greater understanding of the Mass and at least have an idea of what's going on (eg the significance of the primary parts of the Mass: Offertory, Sacrifice, Communion, the origin of the various prayers, the significance of the Vestments and Sacred Linens, etc). It's important that you be aware that it can be very easy for someone to get overwhelmed by the density of information present in the Mass, and that translates to discouragement and detachment. **It's extremely important that you meet her where she is at**, and help her take tiny steps towards learning more about the Mass. \n\nThis starts first and foremost with a good missal (the [AP Daily Missal](https://angeluspress.org/products/genuine-leather-1962-roman-catholic-daily-missal) is a universal favorite), but also don't just buy her a missal and chuck it at her and expect all your problems to be resolved. Sadly there isn't a good resource that I'm aware of that teaches people how to use a missal properly, but if you know how to use one then you should do your best to teach her. If you don't have a missal and can't afford one, then a decent compromise might be to load [this website](https://www.divinumofficium.com/cgi-bin/missa/missa.pl)on your phone and discreetly read from your phone during Mass. Heck with a baby it might even be a lot easier to read from the phone during mass than trying to wrangle and infant and a missal at the same time.\n\nThe important thing to realize is that your wife missed out on a lot of crucial formation as a child (not her fault), so for a time her learning path will closely resemble that of a child, and there is no shame in that. This is also a very good opportunity for the both of you to actively engage in preparing for the education you both will give your son about the Faith. Many times we only really learn about important things because we think it's important for our kids to learn about those things."

One thing my spiritual director has suggested is that I contemplate the four means of prayer prior to mass so I can refer back to those four things every mass. Each mass I have different intentions and prayers and they help to keep me refocused between the feedings and corrections of the children. Perhaps try suggesting something like this? Take the pressure off her to be fully 100% in the mass, due to her station in life that isn‚Äôt realistic.

It's like air travel during the 50's and 60's: everyone loves to talk about how luxurious air travel was back in the \"good old days\", but fail to do the math and realize that a round trip, cross country ticket would cost [the equivalent of $4,000](https://brilliantio.com/how-much-were-plane-tickets-in-the-1960s/). Even if most households looked like the one you described, it's far from ideal and extremely chauvinistic (which is not at all Catholic). \n\nAlso heels and makeup are bad for one's health, so I find it disturbing when men expect women to undergo these things in order to please them.

The public pool actually ended up closing down simply because so few people used it (likely because of the principled stance against mixed swimming among the majority of people in the town). \n\nI would be interested to hear discussion about mixed swimming when it comes to families, whether immediate or extended. My inclination is that it‚Äôs not a good idea but perhaps I‚Äôm too strict."

Anytime explanations are asked for, the Vatican refuses to elaborate, which is suspicious. \n\nSwitching Rites is a big deal for the faithful, and even bigger for priests. You can‚Äôt just go to a Marian Rite one Sunday and then go to an Eastern Rite the next. \n\nOrthodox are schismatic, so it‚Äôs wrong to attend their liturgy just because they have a good track recording of consistency (because they‚Äôre consistently wrong). The Othodox Church cannot be the same Church Christ founded since they deny the primacy of Peter and thus forfeit their Apostolicity, which is one of the 4 marks of the True Church. \n \nThe TLM, whether offered by FSSP, Diocesan, or any other priest is only possible thanks to the SSPX and its founder, Archbishop Lefebvre. The naysayers of the SSPX love to pretend as though  the TLM would still be around if the Archbishop had not resisted the changes, but if you know the history and sequence of events of the past 60 years you know that the TLM is still around thanks to the SSPX. \n\nThose who think that one can endorse all the changes since V2 and expect the Church to thrive in the long run as long as they still have a TLM to attend are at best just ‚Äúsmells and bells Catholics‚Äù, and their Faith is quite superficial."

        "body": ">it's super traditional catholics who aren't in communion with rome?\n\nBy the Vatican's own words that the SSPX aren't in \"regular\" communion with Rome, but both sides are working to achieve that. Which essentially means that they have an \"irregular canonical status\". However, let's be 100% clear here, they are certainly not outside the church. They are fully considered fully Roman Catholic with valid holy orders and you can fulfill  your Sunday obligation there unless your bishop gives you explicit instructions to the contrary. You can also receive valid confession and holy matrimony with the SSPX.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>have SSPX people considered being orthodox then?\n\nNo. This is not typical of SSPX attendees. Orthodoxy lacks a few Catholic dogma which came about after the great schism in 1054. SSPX is fully Catholic and accepts all the same dogma of the faith that Pope Francis and the current magisterium believes in. The defining characteristic of the SSPX is the belief that the Church is in a crisis that arose after Vatican II and the Novus Ordo Mass. To make the leap to Orthodoxy, the typical process would likely be getting convinced that the roots of the crisis come from Vatican I and not Vatican II, at that point it could be possible they would explore Orthodoxy. This subject is very dense so i'll leave it there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>why not just go to a TLM or eastern catholic church?\n\nWell, TLM diocesan churches are being suppressed and outright banned. If anyone can find a diocesan TLM they are welcome to go. However, I think it's worth noting that Diocesan TLM likely wouldn't even have ever existed without Archbishop Lefebvre and the SSPX preserving it. For example, my diocesan TLM Pastor was trained by the SSPX to say the TLM and this is very common.\n\nEastern Catholic church is a completely different tradition. The typical SSPX attendee probably has respect for the Eastern Divine Liturgy and traditions and may even attend a divine liturgy from time to time. However, the SSPX and it's attendees seek to preserve the traditional Latin-Rite. The primary purpose of the SSPX is to save souls, and the secondary purpose is to preserve the liturgy, tradition, customs, as the church goes through the current crisis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you have questions."

The SSPX is a missionary society, so the SSPX Bishops have no jurisdiction. \n\nThe SSPX has chapels all over the world, in places you wouldn't expect. It's always a good idea to send an email to whichever [SSPX District](https://fsspx.org/en/content/5925) you're in (there's a few countries that the SSPX has missions in but for political reasons they have to maintain secrecy) to see if you truly have no options; they will also be able to provide you with contact information of any independent traditional priests who live in the area. Also there's places (such as Dubai) where the SSPX visits every few months but they don't typically advertise it because it's so infrequent.\n\nThe SSPX advises the laypeople to steer clear of the Novus Ordo Mass, but when it comes to confession while you might get some unorthodox advice, the SSPX doesn't question the validity of a \"N.O. Confession\".  If you need to go to confession, then I don't see any issue with you going to a NO Priest. Also don't be afraid to ask a NO priest about the Latin Mass (it really helps if you know how to serve). You never know who among them would like to say a Latin Mass privately so it's always something worth mentioning. A friend of mine asked the military chaplain in basic training about the Latin Mass options and the priest ended up saying a private Latin Mass once a week that he could serve at. \n\nYou might consider having a \"Sunday Routine\" where you spend an hour or so in prayer as well as making a special effort to sanctify the day. We are blessed to have at our disposal quite a range of Masses live streamed from SSPX Chapels on YouTube, so you could even tune in and attend Mass virtually. Also something to consider is if you're able to take trips every few months to places that do have the sacraments."

It's by no means a blanket statement.\n\nTaken from Fr.

Never going to turn someone away who wants to attend Mass.\n\nTo answer the question about 'random' chapels - the Society is maxed on what they can do with their priests right now. That is the limiting factor. Most of the more scattered, smaller-town SSPX locations are from when there were not a ton of locations clamoring to join. Some of them only get Mass once or twice a month. Moral of the story, pray for more priests, because that is hopefully what can allow them to start expanding again."

But still  it was the teaching in this psalm. He did not mention repent or confession in haircloth too. I am not sure the catholic practice at fouth centure.\n\nBut I think haircloth is a way of repent, feel sorry for wrong doing and repent. And a contrit of heart is an acceptable sacrifice.  Fasting is refrain from food, or any form of sense pleasure. You can't miss either of the two, in order to achieve the 3rd,  into my bosom my prayer shall be turned.\n\n By put on haircloth, you let the mortal sins die, and released your own stress, or in another verse \"burn my reins and my heart\" \\[Psalm 25.2\\].

I‚Äôve attended a couple of FSSP Tridentine masses which I love and wish I could attend the TLM exclusively, but I have to do a bit of traveling to get to one so it‚Äôs not easy to make it every time I go to mass.\n\nAnyways I had always sort of looked down on the SSPX since becoming Catholic. It seemed like they were trying to have their cake and eat it too, essentially to hold the position of sedevacantism but still have the good graces of the church.\n\nI realize now that was a bad faith point of view, and that if you guys wanted to be sedes, you would just become sedes. Not like you face much less criticism being SSPX. I‚Äôve been listening to Abp. Lefebvre‚Äôs ‚ÄúOpen Letter to Confused Catholics‚Äù and so much of it rings true. When he started one of the chapters by saying ‚ÄúVatican II was the French Revolution in the Catholic Church‚Äù my mouth dropped. You couldn‚Äôt say it any more succinctly than that.\n\nBeing Catholic in this day and age is already somewhat difficult due to the ostracism that we all face, and I can only imagine that being a ‚ÄúSSPX Catholic‚Äù adds another level of ostracism that you face from people who are supposed to be your brothers and sisters in Christ. I mean even for me it‚Äôs painful to hear people talk about how great V2 was and how were so much better off because of it. Were there some positives? Sure but overall it seems like it was designed to weaken the church and protestantize it.\n\nSo my questions to you all who either do only SSPX or those who do SSPX and NO/FSSP/ICKSP/etc (if there are any): is life harder now? Easier? Did it take a while for it to feel right? Do you ever have second thoughts? Are there any specific things you do not like about being part of SSPX?\n\nCheers and May God bless you all.",

We attend Mass almost every week, we go to confession and receive communication (on the tongue not the hand!), we are on first name basis with most of the congregation at this point and have made friends for life.\n\nI find that people will argue against me more if religion comes into question, moreover because we're traditionalist and people think that we're behind the times and want women to suffer and kids to suffer etc, but that's really not the case. I try to explain but you'll know yourself, people are set in their ways and just want an argument.\n\nBut overall we feel so at home in the SSPX and we have absolutely no regrets, it's changed our faith and made it so strong."

Another argument I've heard is that we veil things that are sacred, and since women bring life into the world, there's a certain sense in which they could be considered sacred. I don't know how traditional this argument is, however. A brilliant series of articles was published by Tradition in Action which explains the reasons for veiling, though I must warn you that it is very long: [https://www.traditioninaction.org/religious/d005rpVeil\\_1\\_Goodman.htm](https://www.traditioninaction.org/religious/d005rpVeil_1_Goodman.htm)\n\nI do support women going back to veiling all the time (though not like the Muhammadans), but that usually gets me labelled a nutter!

Previous to VII, most women at least wore hats when going out and it probably never occurred to the pre-VII Church that there was a need to address it because for the most part, there wasn‚Äôt at the time. But for me that still begs the question-what does God want women to do? The SSPX addresses feminine modesty and dress even outside of mass, except when it comes to headcovering. And of course, the mainstream Church thinks anything goes-even if you‚Äôre wearing a mini skirt to mass. There seems to be a gap in guidance here but I also don‚Äôt want to go making up my own rules or interpreting the Bible myself."

Sometimes a familys situation is just really hard to fix and a large family has large problems. \n\nPeople here say that years ago St Marys was in ‚Äúsurvival mode.‚Äù People were upset with what was happening in the church and moved to St Marys looking for help and answers from the SSPX. There were no jobs in rural Kansas and people were trying desperately to find a good situation for their families. \n \nIn the last 15 years a lot of that has changed. A lot of tough, intelligent and moral people moved here. They started good businesses and now there is money being made and people move here for jobs and not just the church. The SSPX has grown and matured as an organization. There is now good staff, policies and financing in place to make the school and church the best it can be.\n\nIt‚Äôs easy to sensationalize St Marys because the whole places sounds crazy on the surface buts it‚Äôs just the larger version of your typical SSPX chapel.

I attended the college there and that was the best two years of my life.\n\nPros: Extremely easy access to the sacraments, a large number of liturgy offered (Divine office, vespers, etc), a very diverse population (in the true sense), surrounded by large families and clergy, and a new beautiful church that they are 95% completed with and consecrating on May 3rd.\n\nCons: Small town (depending on if you like that or not), economically monolithic (theres really only 1-2 places to work to earn a living unless you plan on working in Topeka and Manhattan and even those are limited depending on what you do for a living), and a general lack of things to do (its a small town in rural kansas after all).\n\nThe other thing ill call out as the biggest con is: an extremely large parish. Cannot tell you how many people I spoke to when I left Saint Marys of how they felt unwelcome coming in, and it felt very closed off from the rest of the world. Some of that is by design, but alot of it is frankly how many people there are there. Im not sure where current numbers stand now but its a parish of about 3-4K (including children). That being said its difficult to make friends or immerse yourself in one of the many sub communities unless you know someone, its just kinda how it works. I remember i came back to visit and sparked up a conversation with someone who I had never met, and mentioned \"Ive never met you before, did you just move here? and he said \"no ive lived here for 25 years\". Gives you an idea of how massive the place is.\n\nNow, regarding your sex scandal questions: I definitely would not say there are \"alot\". Of course, where there is smoke, there is fire, and I do believe there have been some accusations from a couple of individuals regarding this.  I have not peered into the news of these lately but I do not think anyone has been convicted yet. So are there some that are true? Maybe. But there are also many that are 100% false, and people who have a bone to pick with a certain priest or the system or what have you and just trying to bring things down to their level. Pure malice in my opinion. But like I said, im sure sadly that some are true, but I wouldnt base that on the town per se, the abuse happens everywhere sadly.\n\nOverall: I recommend the college and its professors 1000%, truly one of the gifts of the SSPX is that college. Now, Living there as a parishioner long term? for me I decided to move because I wanted to a) be at a parish that actually needs more resources versus Saint Marys where they have literally everything from a parish perspective, b) live in a more populated area for better access to jobs and fun things to do with the kids, and c) wasnt a fan of being 1 of 4000, wanted more of a medium sized parish vibe where I can actually know my parish and the people who attend it."

Also those who are in the habit of making frivolous or baseless accusations are also the ones most likely to run to the media to get their private little crusade won.  \n\n\nIt's extremely unfortunate, but there have been a few sexual scandals that actually did occur, and the reality is it's better to err on the side of \"over reporting\" them, instead of trying to cover them up. The downside of this approach is that the reputation of the SSPX ultimately has to take a hit, but it's much easier to recover from a false accusation reputation loss vs a covered up scandal that was found out reputation loss."

You can also just create your own account with an email and password, and we may add the ability to log in via Google soon.

I'd like to become involved, but I don't know anyone and feel really awkward just...showing up. It doesn't help that the one time I did, people saw my tattoos and straight up ignored me.

It would be seen as an insult to many families who had to put up with the hate and vitriol from the FSSP parishioners for the SSPX leadership to formally pronounce that everything between the FSSP and SSPX is alright. \n\nThe reality is the FSSP is a dying organization and probably won‚Äôt exist in a decade or two, much sooner if the relationship between Rome and the SSPX is fully repaired. The reason the FSSP was founded was so those priests could have the ‚Äúsmells and bells‚Äù while compromising on principles; if the SSPX is granted personal prelature then the SSPX will have the ‚Äúsmells and bells‚Äù without needing to compromise on their principles. It also seems plausible that in that case Rome would also pull a lot of support for the FSSP and other TLM groups and basically tell all their priests they can join the SSPX or be a normal diocesan priest. \n\nHowever it‚Äôs highly unlikely that the SSPX will ever get personal prelature, but that still doesn‚Äôt bode well for the FSSP. The FSSP exists at the whim of the current administration of the Vatican, and they will run into the same problem that the SSPX ran into in the 80‚Äôs: unable to find a Bishop who will ordain the priests. \n\nThe priests of the FSSP don‚Äôt want to be disobedient to Rome, but the reality is there‚Äôs no duty to obey an authority that commands something that is offensive to God, which is the position of the SSPX."

The founder of the SSPX (one of the fathers of Vatican II, a man formerly entrusted with the religious development of most of Africa) saw most of the members of the Church jump off a cliff after Vatican II, and the SSPX is basically just camping out on the cliff edge waiting for the rest of the Church to climb back up to where things were before the changes. \n\nThe SSPX was founded in 1970, 5 years after the close of Vatican II when it was clear that the fruits of Vatican II were plummeting Mass attendance, religious vocations, and in general a decline in the health of the Church.

        "body": "I‚Äôm using the phrase ‚Äúoffensive to God‚Äù in a very broad sense to highlight the fact that at its core the SSPX is doing its very best to fulfill the basic tenets of religion by worshipping God the way He has told us He wants to be worshipped. Obedience to God will always trump obedience to any man. By offensive to God I don‚Äôt intend to accuse heresy, but simply point out that something is suboptimal and able to be criticized and improved. Vatican II clearly has resulted in a lot of negatives for the Church, and I think can broadly be considered offensive to God in some respects. However the hierarchy of the Church since Vatican II has effectively demonstrated that criticism of the council is intolerable and will not be considered (in fact this is always the sticking point of the current talks between the SSPX and Rome, Rome refuses to discuss the Council or elaborate on any of the problematic points). There are legitimate ways of promulgating dogma, but the current administration refuses to use those means and instead demands obedience to its contemporary whims; effectively making Vatican II dogma without actually submitting it to the scrutiny that such a declaration would demand. \n\nAs it happens the SSPX was rarely attacked prior to the episcopal consecrations for its position against Vatican II, but for its adherence to the TLM and the traditional formation of priests. The episcopal consecrations were not performed in defiance of Rome, in fact Archbishop Lefebrve did everything he could to remain on good terms with Rome. Rome approved the consecrations, approved the candidates, but started giving him the run around on approving a date for the consecrations. It became clear to the Archbishop that Rome was stalling and waiting for him to die. The entire point of the Society was to form priests in the traditional manner; and this would not be possible without a traditionally minded bishop to ordain them; which is why the Archbishop made the decision to please God and offend the men in Rome and go ahead with the episcopal consecrations. \n\nThe SSPX has always attempted to remain respectful to the legitimate authorities, which is why pronouncements of heresy are never given because they are not competent to judge someone as a formal heretic. The SSPX doesn‚Äôt want to steer the Church in a different direction, only put on the brakes and reverse back to the critical junction where a hard left turn was made in the 60‚Äôs to discuss the changes made by Vatican II, so in effect the SSPX is sitting back at that juncture waiting for a reasonable explanation for the changes."

The Council explicitly did not produce anything binding, it‚Äôs stated purpose was simply to discuss matters in the Church. However, the revealed preference of the hierarchy since the council has been that it is dogmatic because no one is allowed to question the Council, even to the point of heavily modifying the canonization provides specifically to get the Popes who convened the council and upheld it canonized, thus making it harder to criticize the Council. \n\nIf Vatican II is effectively dogmatic, why was it not convened as such? \n\nAnother example of this unwillingness to use existing methods for proclaiming the teachings of the Church was JP 2‚Äôs statement on female priests. He made the pronouncement using an almost identical formula for an ex cathedra statement (so it seemed like he was invoking the infallibility of the office); but later clarified that he didn‚Äôt intend it to be an infallible statement. In fact the last time an infallible statement was made by a Pope was the proclamation of the dogma of the Assumption in 1950 by Pius XII. \n\nSo basically the Church has specific ways of demanding assent to teachings by all her members, yet the only method that the Post V2 Church seems to use is obedience (‚ÄúI said you have to follow it so you have to‚Äù). \n\nPlease keep in mind that I‚Äôm a lay person, with only a cursory knowledge of the subject so I could be very wrong about all of this but it just seems strange to me that Vatican II is simply not allowed to be seriously criticized by anyone."

One aim of their reforms in the new Order of Mass was to deliberately remove obstacles to Protestant converts and make the Mass ecumenical. We can see the fruits of that. in addition, the reformers changed the theology and doctrine of the Mass with assembly theology and this repackaging the Mass as a meal. The 1969 General Instruction of the Roman Missal was a theological and doctrinal document. When the furor erupted when criticism of the General Instruction arose, the reformers slightly altered the General Instruction in the 1970 edition to make it more acceptable. One theologian said that the ‚Äú cleverness of the revisers ‚Äú ‚Äú saved ‚Äú the reforms from the ‚Äú Post Tridentine theory of sacrifice. ‚Äú"

Possible answers are that no, the Church is by definition preserved from that, ergo a pope may only seem like a heretic when he in fact is not. Or yes, a heretic can manage to get elected. But then the second question is that can a heretic validly be and remain a pope. Then the possible options are yes, the faithful are just supposed to put up with it. Or no, he is automatically excommunicated and the only thing required is his physical removal by force. Or no, but the hierarchy must come to its senses and then proceed to remove the man. What if someone did not just become a heretic after the election but always was one? Roncalli was a suspected Modernist long before 1958, which would by definition make his election illegal and invalid. Also, Pius XII intentionally did not make Montini a cardinal.\n\nIf the Church was hijacked by and for a different system of belief beginning in 1958 and finalized in 1969, one that it fought against for at least a century before it happened, then the question is, who or what is going to hijack it back? And are those people saved or damned who hold this alternative system of belief that the Church always strictly condemned before it took over?\n\nThen the final question is that to believe in the old way, do you only need the TLM and the old sacraments or do you need something more? According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, Traditionalism is a condemned heresy. Put in everyman's terms it means that people are saved by participating in the right kind of appearances.\n\nThen, Sedevacantism is an idea. Sedevacantists are a bunch of people running a very messy shadow hierarchy. Sedevacantism the idea does not necessarily make Sedevacantists the people valid in any way. This is the interesting thing with their so-called Thesis. It is a stratagem to \"steal\" validity for episcopal consecrations from (according to them) a licit but invalid pope. Who, they say, possess the title but not the power. As far as I know, the SSPX thinks the recent popes are illicit but valid. They possess the power but not the title.\n\nI think the most important question is if you can save your soul in Novus Ordo? FSSP? SSPX? Or any of the myriad Sede shops?\n\nAnother way to put this is if in the Church the human element exists for the spiritual, or the spiritual element for the human? If the spiritual element is not there, then what's the point in the human element? Or is the human element the really important one and the spiritual in a way optional?"

It‚Äôs very bad form for you to be begging the question like that, but I‚Äôll attempt to answer your other questions. \n\nThe reason most of the faithful attend the SSPX masses probably comes down to the Catholic principle of ‚Äúlex orandi, lex credendi‚Äù, which is the integral relationship between the manner of worship and the quality of ones faith: a poor manner of praying will undoubtedly result in a poor faith. The Traditional Latin Mass is a rite that has developed from the Last Supper through nearly 2000 years, **slowly** codified and developed into the form we know today; it is the rite that the vast majority of saints would recognize. And then men who happened to be alive decided that they knew much better than the centuries of other men (many of them saints) who came before them, tossed it all out the window and (even deliberately one might suspect) decided a bastardized version was much better and would usher in a new springtime of the Church. \n\nThe SSPX was founded by one of the fathers of the Second Vatican Council, Archbishop Marcel Lefebrve. He was the former Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers at the time when it was one of the largest missionary orders and effectively made him the spiritual father of the entire continent of Africa. During his tenure the continent saw record numbers of baptisms, and also ordinations as he established several seminaries. Pope John XXIII moved him from Apostolic Delegate in Africa to Rome as a member of the Central Preparatory Commission for Vatican II. \n\nAll that is to say the founder of the SSPX was himself a fruit of the traditional way of preparing priests, and had a literal front row seat at the table when this way was completely overturned and could see the terrible fruits of the Novus Ordo and how they stem directly from the poor, haphazard way of forming priests. He founded the SSPX in order to transmit what he had received, which was the traditional formation of a priest as it had been done for centuries (the phrase ‚ÄúI have transmitted what I have received‚Äù is on his gravestone) up until the men moved by the spirit of Vatican II saw fit to toss it all out. \n\nThe SSPX is not doing anything new or unprompted, heck the SSPX gets tons of flack from diocesan traditional Catholics for not being ‚Äútraditional enough‚Äù because they celebrate the TLM with the 1962 rubrics to make it clear they will obey Rome in all that is not dangerous to the faith. The steep drop off in practicing Catholics post NO implementation is a clear indicator of how dangerous the NO is to ones faith. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with celebrating and having a preference for the TLM, the SSPX is the only organization that has made it even possible (every single priest who celebrates it today will trace their training back to the SSPX, the founders of all the TLM organizations in the Church today are all former SSPX). \n\nI strongly recommend you devote 1:44 of your time to watch this documentary and learn about the founder of the SSPX. https://youtu.be/Cf9oy7wDkms"

If you didn't intend it that way I apologize but the question comes off as though you already think you have an answer in mind. \n\n1. Why Latin Mass - the New Mass was designed to appeal to Protestants, the architect of this Mass was not hiding about this, citations are plentiful about this. The texts and actions are diminished in the New Mass and at times entirely replaced and invented. The offertory of the New Mass is a meal prayer from I believe the Talmud, whereas the original offertory speaks of offering this Spotless Host, offered by an Unworthy Servant, the priest, for the salvation of sinners. In the New Mass, the Eucharist is often spoken of as bread, and Christ's arrival is alluded to in future tense as though he wasn't here with us - trained Catholics understand these as metaphors, but many uninformed Catholics don't, and think the Eucharist is not Christ. \n2. Why the SSPX and not any other Latin Mass? Because they pull no punches. They don't agree to dangerous ambiguity, they don't agree to obey a legitimate and true authority that tells them to do something that is demonstrably against Church teaching or damaging to the faithful, and therefore against the will of God. Most other groups seem to be willing to compromise and, although they do so in good faith, and I'm sure most/all/many of them are blameless in this, it's not something I can agree to for myself."

Since priests are obliged to provide the Faithful with the Sacraments (which are necessary for salvation), and since the Faithful cannot receive the Sacraments from priests who do not believe in the Catholic religion (who are Modernists) unless in danger of death, and since the highest law of the Church is the salvation of souls, it would not make sense for the Faithful to be deprived of the Sacraments for the sake of bureaucracy. Canon law concerning the Sacraments exists in order to ensure that the Sacraments are administered properly, by a properly trained priest, and who is under a Catholic bishop in normal times. However, we are not in normal times, and it would be turning the law on its head to use it to prevent the Faithful from receiving the Sacraments at all, which would be the result. It is a principle of canon law that a law ceases to apply when it becomes harmful, which it would in this circumstance. Supplied jurisdiction applies considering the situation that we are in, which is the Society's main justification.\n\nIf one compares mainstream 'Catholicism' with Catholicism as it was in the past, one finds that the recent Popes have been teaching things greatly contradictory to tradition. Since Catholicism is based on tradition, this is something of a problem. For example, throughout the ages the Church has been against the proposition that \"Every man is free to embrace and profess that religion which, guided by the light of reason, he shall consider true\" (from Pius IX's Syllabus of Errors; errors 77 and 78 are also good examples). This is not what is taught any longer. Oecumenism is practiced very publicly by the Popes and encouraged, but this was forbidden throughout the Church's history as communicatio in sacris with heretics and schismatics is indifferentist (it implicitly teaches that all religions are just as good as one another), offensive to God (for God has decreed that he should be worshipped using Catholic rites), and a mortal sin. This quote from the Oath Against Modernism is useful in showing the problem: \"I accept sincerely the doctrine of faith transmitted from the apostles through the orthodox fathers, always in the same sense and interpretation, even to us; and so I reject the heretical invention of the evolution of dogmas, passing from one meaning to another, different from that which the Church first had\". The whole oath is here: [traditionalcatholic.net/Tradition/Prayer/Modernism\\_Oath.html](https://traditionalcatholic.net/Tradition/Prayer/Modernism_Oath.html)\n\nI recommend that you read through the Syllabus of Errors, the decrees of the Pontifical Biblical Commission of 1909, and any teaching prior to the 1960's. You will find that it is very different in these important areas to that of to-day. I also recommend the SSPX podcast, which goes over these problems in detail."

I mean, of course we should avoid the Novus Ordo, since they were designed to work against the will of God by admission of the architects (i.e. remove all stumbling blocks for the Protestants, aka make the Catholic truth less clear, aka create scandal). The 1988 excommunications couldn't have been valid due to the detailed legal requirements of a laetae sententiae excommunication on the grounds used as claim against the Archbishop. The comparisons are indeed quite similar to those saints you mentioned, however I am concerned about calling the Archbishop a saint while simultaneously doubting other official canonizations. I think that position needs to be consistent, and you can maintain his heroism and inquire for his intercession while not making any theological claims about his objective sainthood. Unless I misunderstand, and a saint here refers to any holy soul in heaven or purgatory, and it is more so saying \"we believe this is the case\" rather than \"we make the objective claim that this is in fact the case, and declare a mock canonization\" - I believe the prior is quite consistent."

Not sure which game but I suspect you mean Heir Obscure :)\n\nWould you be able to elaborate about your objections to why the SSPX hold in doubt that Pope John Paul II is a legitimately canonized saint? I understand taking issue with that as a reaction, however I'm not clear what the actual dispute about the reasons are. Because I think the arguments are very strong, which is that the process of canonization was dumbed down, putting things into doubt to begin with, emphasizing that doubt by holding Pope John Paul up as an example of Catholic heroic virtue, while having done some extremely troubling scandalous things, particularly the Assisi meetings, and the various encouragements of false religions. Similar examples include Mother Theresa seemingly having claimed to encourage those in false faiths to remain in their false faiths. These individuals, although having done naturally heroic things, many of their significant public actions cause this kind of scandal, and can't be considered an example to follow. People might downplay those acts and focus on the heroic acts, or they might be so bothered by the scandalous acts that they really don't like the individuals (myself being Polish I highly value the heroic acts of the Pope while being fully convinced of the error of the mentioned scandals), the objective deeds and judgment of the actions of the individuals can't be accepted as an example of heroic virtue. Because canonizations don't just declare \"this individual is in heaven,\" and the way it was explained to me is that the SSPX doesn't make any claims whether they are or not, but they hold the canonizations in doubt, and reject that these individuals should be venerated as heroic ideal examples of the Christian life."

However, if that process is then reduced, changed, treated with much less gravity, and seemingly used to justify and raise up people who would support some poor positions made in the Church, and we can observe objectively that people who did not display heroic virtue getting canonized, one simply cannot look at that and say 2+2=5 - it is clear that SOMETHING is wrong, and one doesn't have to make any claims definitely there other than simply acknowledging that fact. Something is wrong with the new process.\n\nCan you \"accept\" Saint A vs Saint B - well, no. However, you CAN venerate and ask for the intercession of holy men who happened to be canonized despite doubting the process, for example Padre Pio. Archbishop Lefebvre is included in this as well, because I mean, if you follow an order you better believe the founder of your order was a man of strong, heroic faith. And you hope for the canonization of these people while praying for their intercession, piously believing they are in Heaven despite not being given that certainty. That's fine. And it doesn't change the fact that you can't venerate anywhere near the same level individuals who supported and enacted ecumenical movements, for example.\n\nWhy are Archbishop Lefebvre's actions different from Pope John Paul II and Mother Theresa? Well, I know more about the Pope so I will focus on that, but it has to do with what a scandal is. A Pope cannot in any capacity pray with non-believers, pagans, heretics, and schismatics, and cannot affirm their false faith. THIS is a scandal, because it causes people to believe that this is OK to do, and it is even more grave because it is the Pope who is doing it. Scandal means leading people into sin, and allowing false worship, encouraging it, approving it, is by definition enabling and encouraging sin, and at that, in a most public way.\n\nWhether the Archbishop caused a scandal is up for debate, you might believe it is a scandal, but if you had initially been in the SSPX than I am surprised that you would. The Archbishop wouldn't lead anyone into sin if his position is true, that is, that one cannot obey a command to do evil, and that the commands given to him were in fact to do evil. This disobedience would in fact be heroic and a good example worthy of admiration. In any case, no one is claiming Archbishop Lefebvre as having been somehow canonized independently of the due process, while still exercising their legitimate veneration of the admirable founder of their order."

Apostasy is obvious as he promotes worship of earth goddess.(Pachamama) Catholics need to see the truth and open theirs eyes; blinded by an obedience to a systematic acceptance of freemasonry and satanic teachings. The heresy of Francis can be seen as obstinate to the dogma of the Catholic Church. He has been corrected by Cardinals, and he persists in propagating error. This man is a formal, manifest heretic.\n\n\nThere is evidence to support Pope Benedict XVI as a legitimate successor to the papacy even though he has made some erroneous pronouncements which show him to be also in heresy, but only material heresy. You could also include the other councilor‚ÄôPopes‚Äô in this category; because they all were modernist heretics who committed grave errors against ‚Äòde fide‚Äô dogma of the Church. Especially the sin of religious indifference. These ‚ÄòPopes‚Äô were all modernists: John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul I, John Paul II, and Benedict XVI. They all committed the sin of false ecumenism. These shameful false teachers have lead many astray, to twist the faith into a freemasonic and satanic sect of Catholicism which breaks completely with Sacred Tradition:\n\n‚ÄúIt firmly believes, professes and preaches that all those who are outside the catholic church, not only pagans but also Jews or heretics and schismatics, cannot share in eternal life and will go into the everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels, unless they are joined to the catholic church before the end of their lives;‚Äù{Pope Eugene IV, Council of Florence, Cantate Domino, 1441, ex cathedra}\n\nWe must do more than recognize and resist. For by following in obedience to these errors, we are in complicity with falsehood and evil. By submitting to Francis as a legitimate Pope, we are giving him authority which he has ipso facto relinquished by his obstinate heresy. Francis has put himself outside the very Church he claims to lead. He is an apostate, and while sad, painful, and heartbreaking‚Äîwe are called to pray for his conversion."

My understanding is the Third Order is more of a local community thing, so it would make sense to see what your local Third Order members do. \n\nFor better or worse, few priests make a distinction between passive viewing and channel surfing when it comes to TV (essentially time wasting) or intentional viewing of content on a device that happens to be referred to as a TV. This is largely because the priests themselves have little time to even think about doing these kinds of things, sort of like how the priest's advice on social media can be a bit out of touch because so few of them actually use it. \n\nI think a case can be made that cable TV has no place in the Catholic home due to the lack of control over what is played over it (especially when it comes to ads), but also I think Catholics need to remember that the list of things that absolutely must happen in order to get to heaven is pretty short."

The article suggests the UGCC is utterly Ukrainian turning away Russian or Russian speaking Orthodox priests discerning conversion (although there can be no doubting of their patriotism while UA faces Russian invasion).  The SSJK anyhow follow the same SSPX line of professed loyalty to Rome but rejecting Modernism and Indifferentism. However, unlike SG Dom Pagliarini, I don't see Fr Kovpak dropping into Pope Francis for a chat (the Pope was Ordinary of Buenos Aires while Fr Pagliarini was the local SSPX seminary rector)  as happened with the SSPX SG. There is a clearer recognition of the SSPX vis √° vis Rome compared to SSJK and either Rome or Ukrainian UGCC authorities."

They aren‚Äôt even ‚Äúofficially‚Äù considered in schism, in fact. \n\nIt‚Äôs a scary world we live in, where modernists disregard ‚Äúextra ecclesiam nulla salus‚Äù and recommend praying with Protestants and attending clown masses but say a TLM will endanger souls.

The status of the SSPX are abrogated since the 70s, and even these statues were limited in the Diocese of Fribourg and for six years.\n\nThe Church can't teach heresy. SSPX has no mission in the Church, and it spreads many errors and even heresies. As I said, it is a catholic dogma that canonical mission is required for the legitimate ministry (Council of Trent, sess. 23, can. 7), and as said all theologians, bishops, etc : it is the meaning of the dogma. So the Universal Ordinary Magisterium also taught this dogma as I said, and you can't say that \"you don't understand the meaning of the dogma\", because the Church understands it as I said.\n\nI am not a modernist, and I believe in all dogmas of the Church. You believe that TLM is so good that no external circumstances can render this Mass bad ; but first I never said that all TLM Masses endanger souls ; second, yes, Masses (either TLM, Novus Ordo or Oriental) said by not canonically sent priests are bad for souls, not because of the rite itself, but precisely because it is said by an illegitimate priest, so it is an illegitimate Mass.\n\nYou commit the sin of slander towards me when you say that I'm a protestant. Also, I don't understand your last sentence. If you believe that I'm interested into converting to sedevacantism, that's false (btw it denies the same dogma as I said above), but if I'm interested by it, it is because it is a schism and a corpus of heretical doctrines that needs to be refuted."

I myself do not personally know anyone who attends an SSPX mass as there are no chapels close to where I live (from what I've found the closest are in Waterloo IA, a few in Minnesota, and Rapid City SD, and there are none in Nebraska where I grew up) so I don't have a chance to really find out much about attendance at such chapels.",

If their faith is based on the personal holiness of individual Christians, then they‚Äôre probably going to completely lose their faith soon and they‚Äôre just throwing shade on Catholics. Answering your question specifically, the infallibility of the Pope does not mean they are without fault, only that his specific ministry in the Church provides a negative guarantee that he will not teach error as Truth formally and in his role as Pope. We‚Äôve had some notoriously bad popes. I say the present Pope is pretty bad. Not necessarily because of his moral life, but because of his theological confusion, yet we see the charism playing out even here, when Francis says things confusing or puts forward a heretical teaching as a personal opinion or off-hand remark, its doesn‚Äôt cross that important line. Even in the Encyclicals, the verbiage is confusing, odd, and mostly unclear, or problems appear in footnotes rather than the main text. It is no small miracle that while we probably have a personally heretical pope, yet he hasn‚Äôt made himself a Material Heretic by formally proclaiming a theologically unsound teaching. It‚Äôs almost as if something [or someone] is stopping him. The Holy Spirit is at work with what we give the Church to work with ‚Äî which is sadly lacking."

Remember that the slightly different wording of the Creed is a more ancient one and it DOES NOT deny the essential doctrine of the Filioque but rather excludes it from the Creed, which even early Popes supported doing until the Frankish Kings pushed for its inclusion.\n2. The Divine Liturgy is beautiful; savor it!\n3. All of this said, I'd recommend that you ensure that certain traditional practices are followed to prevent yourself from being scandalized:\n   1. Make sure there's an iconostasis (even if it's not much... some Eastern parishes are dirt poor).\n   2. Make sure the Eucharist is dispensed in the traditional means (by intinction, from a communion chalice with a spoon); I saw something in this comment section about Dixie cups and was quite disappointed.\n   3. I'd pick Melkite, Ukrainian, or Romanian over Ruthenian if possible; the new Ruthenian liturgical books use gender-neutral language when describing mankind, and while I believe some of their priests may still use the old books, it's rather disappointing.\n   4. As for non-Byzantine Eastern Churches, know that they tend to be more modernized/Latinized. Syro-Malabar, Chaldean, and Maronite Catholics are especially so. I believe that Syriacs, Syro-Malankaras, and some of the smaller ones (a few Russian parishes and an Italo-Greek parish under other particular Churches' jurisdictions) are probably less latinized or modernized.\n\nAnyway, thanks for coming to my Eastern TED Talk ;)"

I have found only FlixBus to Deming once a day (15 USD). Uber is insanely expensive, as expected - like half of the flight price around globe. I see on the map railway near by, but I have not found any information about any trains there.\n\nThere is also airfield near Silver City, that costs around 100 USD per flight to Phoenix or Albuquerque.  So I might use that...",

One of them was that if someone intentionally goes to a confessor who will listen to him in hurry or goes to confess to a priest who has hearing problems so that this priest won‚Äôt understand his sins-the confession will be invalid\nAnd I have read this part and I have known about this for some years already\nAnd now I‚Äôm afraid mabye this could be why I chose the older priest today so my confession from today might be invalid?",

I personally don't think your confession was invalid because you were actually trying to confess everything, weren't holding anything back, repeated some things several times to make sure you were heard, and truly want to please God. I don't think choosing the older priest was an issue.\n\nIm a layperson, just like you, and any other advice on this is not going to be what you need because you are going to try to reason your way into the confession being invalid and will probably go back to confession. If you're scrupulous and have OCD you need a regular confessor who knows about this issue that you can confess to so that your mind will be at ease and he can give you appropriate advice and penances that will help you overcome this. I'm saying this with charity; you really need some help. You're torturing yourself. Talk to your priest and let him know about this and he will be more than happy to help you.\n\nEDIT \nI checked your post history. You need a regular confessor and therapy. Seek out a Cognitave Behavioral Therapist (I see a Catholic one for my ADHD) and he will help you develop real strategies for overcoming these issues (this is different than talk therapy because CBT utilizes the whole body). Your brain is literally addicted to thinking these thoughts and your priest and therapist will help you break this cycle. You don't have to live like this. Peace."

It seems more probable to me that this was minor sin, next time go to the other priest, so your conscience would be clear.  E. g. at the end of easter octave.\n\nTo make a mortal sin is harder than scrupulous souls think and is easier than think the lax ones.\n\nTo make it a grave sin, the choose of the confessor must be more than average significant. For example the bad priest would \"give\" you absolution even if he would know, you do not want to change your sinful life - e. g. manager of abortion house. That would be a grave sin, because he would not normally receive the absolution from other priest.\n\nYou can look at your case and ask, if the other priest would probably refuse to gave you a confession or not. Do not invent anything special, just look on what is the most probable."
