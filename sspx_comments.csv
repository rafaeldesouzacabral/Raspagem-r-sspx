1nu40lf,"Supporting SSPX priests, what are the things to consider?",ngypea3,forbiddenq,6,"1. No. Example: After TC, Costa Rican Conference of Bishops issued a nationwide total ban on the TLM, even sent a Diocesan who wanted to continue the TLM to mental health therapy, they basically kicked out FSSP and ICKSP overnight who had a small but steady presence. The SSPX stayed and continues to grow. Virtually the only TLM offered aside from a couple of sede priests and some private hidden diocesan latin masses I hear rumors about. 2. Depends on many factors, but early founding SSPX missions in Latin America usually begin with private masses held in people's living rooms. The first chapel here was held in a private property, not owned by SSPX. Still is, proper chapel still hasn't begun construction. 3. No, Bishops can't interfere, these are private domiciles."
1nu40lf,"Supporting SSPX priests, what are the things to consider?",ngyorki,Spiritual-Anybody-18,3,"You cannot obey prelates although exercising legitimate authority they have abandoned the faith by teaching heresy and order you to attack God. You can only obey the legitimate commands that he does, that is that don't attack faith and either are neutral or just personal in nature (like he treating you wrongly or unjustly but that is not an attack on the faith or he ordering something good for the faith). The SSPX is operation survival of tradition.  ""bishop have any right to close a private chapel given that it is NOT a property of his diocese"" he has an ecclesiastical right but cannot be obeyed by the SSPX because most likely he would not provide the faithful with the true mass and sacraments. Legally he cannot do it (funnily thanks to the secularization of the society this same clergy promoted see latest comments of Pope Leo asking for a ""Responsible secularization""). But would depend on the country."
1nu40lf,"Supporting SSPX priests, what are the things to consider?",ngze30x,sparkle-possum,2,"1. Is a no for sure. The SSPX has been a literal godsend both in the years before Summorum Pontificum (when Pope Benedict allowed for more widespread celebration of the TLM) and in the more recent years of bishops basically banning it from much of their diocese.  My bishop is heavily suppressing the TLM in our area and many people have started or plan to start attending the local-ish SSPX church.2. Not sure, this will probably depend on individual circumstance and location. 3. As far as I know, no. Following COVID, when some of our local NO parishes decided to remove some of the '70s innovations and try to instill more tradition and reverence into their parishes, a group of people started having their own Mass at a local rec center with a retired priest officiating. If that is allowed, then I really don't see how they could disallow it in somebody's private chapel."

The problem isn‚Äôt the declaration of invincible ignorance because Trent left space for it as well, and yes in probably very rare cases on could attain salvation through extraordinary means. It‚Äôs the documents on ecumenism that seem to be ambiguous on Islam and Judaism."
1npxyav,How would you respond to this?,ng4q0a4,Willsxyz,4,"I do not wish to respond to the entire article, but I will respond to this part:>One of the most obvious problems with the claim that there is ‚Äúno salvation outside the Church,‚Äù is that it seems unjust. In the case of those who have never heard about Christianity, how can their salvation depend upon faith + baptism? Denying them salvation seems to be punishing them for something that is beyond their control.The writer is making an error here in equating damnation with punishment. In fact, due to original sin, human beings are all born without the right to Heaven. For this reason, damnation is the default condition of human souls and not a punishment. This has been well understood for centuries, if not millennia. e.g. Dante placing the souls of virtuous pagans in the first circle of Hell.When we speak of justice, we are concerned with whether someone has, or has not, attained that to which they have a right. If I have a right to something, but that thing is denied me, we call that injustice. If I don't have a right to something, and that thing is denied me, we don't call that injustice. So to say that is ""unjust"" for those who have never heard of Christianity to be refused Heaven is like saying that it is unjust for kindergarten children to be turned away at the polling station or the liquor store.It is baptism that gives us the right to Heaven. The unbaptized therefore have no right to Heaven, and their damnation is therefore not unjust.Ok, so if the damnation of those who are unbaptized through no fault of their own is not unjust, is it nonetheless somehow ""punishing them for something that is beyond their control""? Well, the Church teaches that all persons will receive their due reward or their due punishment, and that the degree of reward or punishment depends on what the person has done during their life. Although an unbeliever may not attain Heaven, it does not necessarily follow that they suffer torments in Hell. We can imagine a ""virtuous unbeliever"", who did his best to follow the natural law, and did penance for his failures having little or no pains of sense in Hell, much as we can imagine the unbaptized infants -- although not enjoying the beatific vision and therefore technically damned -- existing in a state of natural bliss."

1nont0u,Elbows on Communion Rail,nftxjct,SnowWhiteFeather,2,When I was going through catechism a few years ago our priest told me not to touch the communion rail.

1nnvjxr,The New Mass vs. the Traditional Latin Mass of All Time,nfqil00,Super_Steve55,3,"I strongly feel like it would be important to note however that Spiritual Growth is very much possible within the Novus Ordo when done correctly and Faithfully (case and point: me), however restrained or something, it does still have the Real Presence (if one doesn't mess up the Mass entirely), as it is fundamentally a Valid Mass. Because, I share the belief that the Tridentine Mass will always be superior, as it is Infallibly Confirmed (and the Novus Ordo likewise isn't), but to say ""never go at all costs avoid avoid because protestant yadda yadda"" jeopardises some 1 billion Catholics, who, either out of necessity in knowledge or unknowledge, may still Faithfully seek Christ, and seek the unchangeable Sacrifice of the Mass, even if such Truth ends up diluted, it can't be forsaken without forsaking the Validity of the Mass."

So yes, they will continue to accept papal authority.

This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. **They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity.** Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition.This is continued in article 2359:>**Homosexual persons are called to chastity**. By the virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.So for those people who have SSA, they are called to live a life of chastity, uniting their struggle with that of Our Lord's on the cross. This is no different to any person who is not SSA who also experiences lust or temptation to sin in a grave way.The church cannot bless sin, but it can facilitate those of us, of which there are many, who are in a state of sin, a path to sacramental grace."

The newer Mass leans much and more into this idea of the Eucharist as a communal meal like the Last Supper and you can see it in the shift from the high altar to the more table-like altar facing the people and the priest facing them so they can see everything that's going on, and that also shifts the orientation of the Mass as something that is seen as, while still being offered to God, is viewed more as offered for the benefit of the people gathered there.It's subtle but, even if it was not intended to be that way, in practice this ends up shifting a lot of people's entire understanding of the Mass away from its true purpose - to glorify God, thank Him, atone for sin, and ask for His grace and blessings through the Sacrifice of Christ on Calvary made present on the altar - to a more Protestant understanding of worship that sees it as primarily to ""feed"" us spiritually in terms of edification (spiritual self-improvement) and what the people gathered obtain from it."

The beauty of formal Catholic prayer ensures my mind is lifted up to God and reminds me of the things I need to pray for, to give thanks for. But I also add a bit of my own thoughts and words in so that it remains personal and from the heart too. Remember God already knows our hearts and minds, and knows exactly what we need.

I thank Him for my blessings in the past week. I ask for blessings for those I love and for myself. I think about what Jesus suffered for us and commit to the next week of doing better.

1ng7ucp,feminism and liberalism,ne2qy74,craft00n,7,"Hi, french trad cath here. Philosophy student, psychology therapist at the end of the year, one of my brothers and one of my uncles are priests in SSPX. US SSPX catholics tend to be influenced by protestantism, and therefore to be a bit more ""conservative"" on social issues than authentic catholicism. So take the answers with a good pinch of salt.[1] The problem isn't the right to vote or anything like that. Feminism has two major problems :- The fact that its goal is ""more freedome for women"" and not ""the greater good"". Tbh, the right to vote was 100% a good idea in terms of greater good, but the intentions behind feminism is rotten to it's core. Fighting for consent, women's right to vote, wage equality (when inequalities are real), and ending things that could reasonably be called ""rape culture"" (like blaming the foolish victims so much that you don't even condemn the perpetrators), are very good things, but feminism do so for bad reasons.- The last waves of feminism, because they want women's right and not the greater good, have progressively fought for objective wrongs like abortion and contraception. We could write more about that if you want.[2] All things equal, the more people are educated, the best. ""Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."" (John 8:32). The problem is that women's education is frequently motivated by the idea that women should be ""self sufficient"", whereas NOBODY is self sufficient. You'll always depend on your husband/spouse/parents, and furthermore one your fellow parishioners and co-workers. Education should be pursued for the greater good and because beauty and perfection of the mind is a good thing per se, not because it's a way to individualism.[3] You're globaly 100% right : modern males and females are not wedding material, so no male or female want to get married and everybody ends lonely. But because mariage in a non christian world is slavery of the woman to the man's desire (Leo XIII, Arcanum, 1880), the men are the first complaining about loneliness.[4] I myself am very much interested in catholic anticapitalism (Chesterton, Belloc, Mainvielle, Sarda y Salvany, Saint-Simon), and I 100% consider that capitalism is the main cause of the destruction of traditional family, with how the nobility used mariage during the middle age being the second cause. Trad caths are sometimes very reluctant to go full anticapitalism because, in the modern world, the alternative is communism, which is at least as false than economic liberalism (which is the ethic behind capitalism)[5] Very very interesting point. All humans have the same natural end, being animals : having children. But some lack natural ease to do so. The very question is : how could you be the most useful for the greater good. Being a good mother is the most obvious way as a woman, the same as being a good father is the most obvious way as a man. But it is best to be a good single doctor/scientific/other than a bad mother. So you should simply pray God for the strength to do as is best in His will : apparently, for now, mother doesn't seem the best for you (you're still a bit young, it could change, but let's say it won't), so maybe you'll end as a nun (could be very mystical, or teaching, or even studying theology or something else, as dominicans have always done), or something else like a uni teacher or anything else.Edit : Looking into your reddit history, I see that you seem to speak fluent german, are interested in dialectical materialism, and have already asked a question about women here, which I tried to give an answer that you seem to have been interested in. I'm very interested in marxism too, as it's my worst enemy, as a thomist. Marxism is the second most strong philosophy/worldview, behind thomism, sooo yeah I better know it. In short : you will have to choose between marxism and catholicism. Maybe read ""Divini Redemptoris"" (Pius XI, 1937) to get where catholicism is opposed, and then maybe learn a bit about thomism, starting with the 24 theses and Pascendi (Pius X, 1907), and after that, well, you'll be ready to take a look at Saint Thomas himself, or maybe through Ed Feser, or many other english thomist channels... Long story short : welcome to philosophy and theology sis."
1ng7ucp,feminism and liberalism,ne3g6vj,Willsxyz,4,"**Answer (2/2)**4. You are moving into intellectual areas with which I am unfamiliar. My sense is that, in general, traditional Catholics should not be ideological capitalists. Traditional Catholic social teaching is that the right to own property, and to buy and to sell, to gain profit from one's work is God-given, and therefore unassailable. However, that does not mean that the economic system of the USA is in conformity with Catholic social doctrine. Corporations and businessmen here seek to increase their own wealth without end, even when the result is the financial destruction of their own workers and associates. I am reminded of a scene in the movie ""The Founder"" about the beginning of the McDonald's hamburger restaurant chain. In this scene, Ray Kroc, the ""founder"" of the McDonald's corporation explains to the McDonald brothers, from whom he has wrested control of the business, that his approach to business is such, that if he saw a drowning man (his competitor in business), instead of saving him, he would put more water in his mouth to drown him more quickly. It is apparent that this attitude is immoral.You might be interested in some of the writings of Pope Leo XIII on this topic. They are from the late 19th century, but still relevant:[https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf\_l-xiii\_enc\_15051891\_rerum-novarum.html](https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum.html)[https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf\_l-xiii\_enc\_28121878\_quod-apostolici-muneris.html](https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_28121878_quod-apostolici-muneris.html)5. You have no obligation to marry. You are free to pursue your interests. You might wish to marry at a later time or, having completed your studies, enter a religious order, or simply remain single. You should remember, however, that our goal on Earth is to know, love, and serve God as best we can, and whatever we choose to do in life, it should primarily serve this purpose. If some other person were to criticize you for your life choices (assuming that you are not living a life of sin) then it is best to simply ignore them. You are obviously an intelligent young woman and I wish you the best."
1ng7ucp,feminism and liberalism,ne3g2ly,Willsxyz,3,"**Answer (1/2)**Hi. I think you have already gotten some good answers, but I will give you my perspective. Unfortunately, unlike u/craft00n, I have not studied philosophy so please consider my answers to be coming from my instinct rather than from knowledge of traditional Cathollic philosophy and theology. You should also know that I am American and I have daughters around your age, two already at university, one still in school.Ich habe vier Jahren in Deutschland gelebt und dort die deutsche Sprache erlernt. Ich kann also Deutsch sehr gut lesen. Weil aber mein Aufenthalt in Deutschland vor 20 Jahren beendet worden ist und ich mich kaum noch mit der deutschen Sprache besch√§ftige, ist meine Schreibfertigkeit etwas nachgelassen. Daher schreibe ich lieber auf Englisch, damit ich nicht allzu lange Zeit verbringe, und nicht allzu viele Fehler der Grammatik und Rechtschreibung machen. Okay?1. As I said, I have two daughters already in university, so I have no problem with women studying at university. I am in favor of women receiving education, if they wish, and of women having the right to own property. I will tell you that among traditional Catholics in the USA, there are many whose daughters do not go to university, but also many of their sons do not go to university, even if the father and mother did attend university. I think this is because these families do not wish to send their children to secular universities (which are, indeed, awful in many ways), but there are few good Catholic universities, and they are expensive.As far as voting goes, I like to tell my children that democracy is not a Catholic value. By that, I do not mean that I dislike democracy, but rather that, for Catholics the system of government is less important than the nature of government. Catholics should desire a confessional state. That is, a state in which the government is explicitly Catholic in confession, and the government and Church work together harmoniously to build a Catholic society. Of course we Catholics may not accomplish this by violence, but rather by conversion of the people. Whether the political system in this state is a democracy, a constitutional monarchy, an absolute monarchy, etc. is less important than the fact that the society and government are Catholic.Having said that, since we do live in a democracy, Catholics (both men and women) should vote and, in principle, I am not opposed to women voting. However, I do think that husbands and wives (assuming both are Catholic) should agree among themselves for whom they will vote and both should cast their votes for the same candidates.2. I do not oppose wives working outside the home when there are no children, or if it is a matter of true financial necessity (not the necessity to go on holiday, but the necessity to pay the rent). When there are children, however, it is best for the mother to be at home to take care of the children. Even when the children go to school, I don't think it is a wise idea to allow them to come home to an empty house.3. You are absolutely correct about the problems we see among the youth. It is no surprise to me that young women are not interested in marrying young men who act like small children and who display no maturity. It is very important, in my opinion, for Catholic parents to make sure that their children do not fall into the trap of extended immaturity, and other specific vices such as addition to porn, gaming, tiktok-doomscrolling, etc. Therefore, I do not allow my children to access the internet without supervision until they go to university (where I can not supervise them in any case). Of course this also means that they may not possess a smartphone. We also have no television in the house. Nonetheless, my children are permitted to watch some TV shows, and some movies, and I try to expose them in a limited manner to pop culture and the wider society. I do not want my children to get out ""into the world"" and think that I have been keeping them trapped in a Catholic bubble. Children who are kept from all secular influences while growing up often experience a crisis of faith, or lose their faith entirely, when they finally leave their parents' home.The other point you mentioned that I want to address is divorce. The Catholic church teaches that marriage is indissoluble. Once a man and woman are validly joined in holy matrimony, there is no possibility of divorce. It can happen that a woman marries a man who (presumably later) turns out to be lazy, or treats his wife disrespectfully. That is a problem, but divorce is not an acceptable (or a possible) answer. In some cases of abuse the Church does allow separation, but separation is not divorce, and it is not possible for either the husband or wife to find a new partner after the separation. Indeed, they should still cooperate in raising their children,  and be willing to live together again if the problem that caused the separation is overcome."
1ng7ucp,feminism and liberalism,neckeny,undeadcookie123,2,"Others have given great answers but I thought I'll add my own two cents if it helps.1. Feminism itself has fundamentally unchristian beginnings. I'd suggest reading ""The End of Woman: How Smashing the Patriarchy has Destroyed Us"" by Carrie Gress along with more of her books on the subject. I think you will find it quite interesting. In a nutshell, at least the way I understood, feminism is correlated with dechristianisation of the west as gender roles began to lose their foundation as there was no logical or philosophical reason, at least one that was objectively grounded, to maintain them. Feminism, at its core, sought to make women the same as men and early feminists despised housewives, and marriage in general, as they saw it only as enslaving of women. Most, if not all, of early feminists were divorced promiscuous women, which are not good fruits to be judged by. Ultimately, since they have removed God from the equation, marriage became enslavement instead of a mutual self-giving rooted in love.2. It is not wrong for women to work or study period. However, as you said, she cannot value her career more than her family, as her primary duties lie in the latter. I feel like the following verse is applicable as well: ""For where thy treasure is, there is thy heart also."" (Mt. 6:21). Most women, like most men, have historically always worked, and the way I see it is that the question really is trying to ask if women can work outside the home, which also is not fundamentally wrong, though not ideal. As u/Willsxyz said, you do not want children to come back to an empty house. But even children aside, the woman cannot really be a good wife while also working full-time outside the home, at least it seems too strenuous to me to do without good reason.3. Very valid issue, both men and women in the younger generations, to which I also belong, predominantly do not possess the qualities that would make them good partners. Most young people in the west have no care in the world, and if we are talking about non-religious then it is virtually hopeless, and it is similar in modern Catholic circles too. I have met quite a few decent men and women in Traditional Catholic circles though, so that's where I would suggest to look. I have heard it is a common trope among radical conservatives that women should do all the work, you know the redpill nonsense, but it has nothing to do with Catholic gender roles so if you ever want to find a good man to marry, he should be a good Catholic to  treat you well.4. You are exactly right with your observation that women were overburdened with work and household duties, however, I do not think it is necessarily an issue which resulted from industrialisation as much as it is a feminist issue at its core. Correct me if I'm wrong, but feminists fought for the right to work, and then realised it is extremely arduous to be a wife, mother and employee at once (as I mentioned in the answer to paragraph 2), but unwilling to let go of the work, the alternative being enslavement and dependance on their husbands, they began outsourcing the wifehood and motherhood to other women whom they would also employ, which is an issue remaining to this day. You say domestic labour no longer counted, but to whom? Do you think good husbands did not appreciate and value their wives' work? That the capitalist machine which seeks to extract all the bit of monetary value out of every individual did not value the output of a mother is wrong on every level and this is where I think is what as Catholics we need to do to change the world for the better. Capitalist, in essence, is not evil, as it is merely an economic model, but unchecked Capitalism is. The governments must place restrictions on Capitalism in their countries in order to ensure the tool works for the benefit of the nation that the benefit of the few at their expense. I will admit I am not well-versed in economic theories, so I cannot provide a detailed answer as to how things should be, but following the guidelines in Pope Leo XIII's encyclical Rerum Novarum would be a good start.5. You don't have to confine yourself to be a nurse or a kindergarten teacher. Considering your age, I'd suggest pursue your faith first and foremost, do follow what you are passionate about, and perhaps in a few years you will find a man who shares your interests whom you will want to marry. Since you lack much of an interest in romance as of now, if that remains, you may consider religious life, as someone else here mentioned. You could pursue your passions and dedicate your life to the ultimate good which is God, while also not having to be around people all the time. In any case, you need to grow in your faith and with time the right decision will seem clearer to you. May God bless you and guide you in your searching for answers."

1ng7ucp,feminism and liberalism,ne3ajwk,sparkle-possum,3,"I can't answer your questions on theory as deeply as some others here but for number 4 I did want to point out that it's not so much that Communism sounds like a worse alternative but did it has been specifically condemned or rejected by the church and many popes, along with socialism (which makes sense if you look at socialism in the Marxist sense as a prelude to communism, because for the many things Marxist theory gets right, it ultimately leads to totalitarianism and is a very materialist worldview which places economics and the market above individualism at almost always ends up placing it above human rights as well). At the same time, and also rejects pure capitalism that places materialism above human rights and the rights of workers, but in the past two centuries it has been communist and socialist societies that have persecuted the Church more directly.>The Church has rejected the totalitarian and atheistic ideologies associated in modem times with ""communism"" or ""socialism."" She has likewise refused to accept, in the practice of ""capitalism,"" individualism and the absolute primacy of the law of the marketplace over human labor.207 Regulating the economy solely by centralized planning perverts the basis of social bonds; regulating it solely by the law of the marketplace fails social justice, for ""there are many human needs which cannot be satisfied by the market.""208 Reasonable regulation of the marketplace and economic initiatives, in keeping with a just hierarchy of values and a view to the common good, is to be commended. 207. Cf. CA 10; 13; 44.208. CA 34.- [Catechism of the Catholic Church 2425](https://share.google/bicyQABe9J3RbWVEt)The closest view/system that's fully compatible with Catholicism would be distributism, which I admit I still have a lot more to learn about, but the article below gives a kid explanation of it and also recommends some books for further reading: [Reading on Distributism] (https://share.google/CUQu5Hhu6KKqfY4hW)You will probably also want to read the two people encyclicals that it is grounded in: Rerum novarum (1891, Pope Leo XIII) & Quadragesimo anno (1931, Pope Pius XI).Finally, yes it's very common for nuns to be educated and there are even a few female doctors of the church. Saints like Catherine of Siena & Teresa of √Åvila were educated and their writings influenced theology, philosophy, and even both secular and papal politics. For much of history, religious life was actually the best chance a woman had at pursuing higher education and devoting herself to study and teaching. Think about it, even those orders that do nursing and teaching require education for those roles and Dominican orders especially have study and preaching is part of their charism and often include an in-depth study of theology, including for women.As the other responder pointed out, a lot of what is labeled traditionalism in America is very influence by fundamentalist and evangelical religion, which is very influenced by right-wing politics and often a disordered obsession with gender roles as interpreted through the lens of of a modernist and ultimately Calvinistic view of patriarchy (I know that last part sounds counterintuitive but Calvin's blends of secular philosophy and political thought with religion was part of the early modern movement which set the groundwork for modernism).Many of these guys would make the same mistakes regarding gender roles that communists and hardcore socialists make regarding the place of economics and materialism in social thought and, making that error and giving those things primacy above religious and interior life, would have probably condemned many women who have been canonized or have otherwise lived pious lives that sought to advocate for the greater good through education and influenced and sometimes even challenged religious and secular authorities."

1ne2c7w,What do you use for veiling?,ndlyojl,HiberniaDublinensis,3,"Traditionally in Ireland they women didn't have any special head coverings for Mass, they just wore what they always wore around their necks and over their heads as part of the traditional dress of the country. A lot of women also wear a type of scarf over their head.Mantillas are a Spanish thing and had no presence in this part of the world until in the past few years young girls started seeing them on the internet and copying them, ordering them online. It's a bit cringe to see but they'll snap out of it eventually. More and more young people are taking an interest in their national heritage and slowly but noticeably the number of women at the Latin Mass covering their heads with something that's actually part of their culture and not something they got off the internet because they saw it online is increasing.I don't know where you are but my advice would be to find something that's part of the local tradition. Probably ask your grandmother what she and her mother and grandmother covered their heads with at Mass. You mention silk scarves or hats, those are fine things to wear to Mass and there's nothing wrong with it. If you don't have it then wear whatever you have. Something is better than nothing.I wouldn't worry about standing out. I mean, by attending the TLM you're already standing out from the other 99.9% of society.>But lately I‚Äôve felt like I should start veiling at mass because, besides the humble symbolic gesture a veil is, it feels disrespectful to not wear one and considering all women wore head coverings at mass until the 60s, I even more feel obligated to do the same.Given how new you are you may not have heard it before but head covering for women is more than just a gesture, it's a Biblical teaching. The same goes for men uncovering their heads. Both are equally important."
1ne2c7w,What do you use for veiling?,ndm6a5m,Routine-Message5122,3,"During the winter, I wear whatever scarf is best for the outfit and move it to conceal my hair during mass. During the summer, I wear a black lace veil (I just prefer black for the vibes). I‚Äôm not sure if this is only my opinion, but I really avoid the more transparent veils and scarves. Seems to kind of negate the purpose. Veiling is wonderful, and use whatever works!"
1ne2c7w,What do you use for veiling?,ndmdzgg,Habemus_Username,2,"Honestly, whatever suits your style.In Europe we get a mixture of lace-veils (white is usually for unmarried ladies, black/other colours is for married women traditionally) and the most common alternative is veiling with silk-like scarves, like the ones that people used to wrap around the handle of handbags etc. Hats are also a good idea, especially in the context of more formal occasions - but sometimes people who aren't in the know might tell you to remove your hat in church.   (In the UK they know that women are usually expected to keep their hats on in church)."
1ne2c7w,What do you use for veiling?,ndlz6hc,HiberniaDublinensis,3,">Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ. Now I praise you, brethren, that in all things you are mindful of me: and keep my ordinances as I have delivered them to you. But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered, disgraceth his head. But every woman praying or prophesying with her head not covered, disgraceth her head: for it is all one as if she were shaven.>For if a woman be not covered, let her be shorn. But if it be a shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald, let her cover her head. The man indeed ought not to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man. For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man. For the man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man. Therefore ought the woman to have a power over her head, because of the angels.>*""A power"": that is, a veil or covering, as a sign that she is under the power of her husband: and this, the apostle adds, because of the angels, who are present in the assemblies of the faithful.*>But yet neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord. For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman: but all things of God. You yourselves judge: doth it become a woman, to pray unto God uncovered? Doth not even nature itself teach you, that a man indeed, if he nourish his hair, it is a shame unto him? But if a woman nourish her hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering.[The First Epistle of Saint Paul to the Corinthians 11:1-15](https://www.drbo.org/chapter/53011.htm)"

I also feel like hats are more formal and even though mass is an occasion for formal wear, I feel like wearing a hat at my local parish would rather look overdressed and look oriented, since, like you said, most women wear scarfs or lace veils for mass."
1ne2c7w,What do you use for veiling?,ndm121a,HiberniaDublinensis,3,Culture is always changing of course but unless you're Spanish then mantillas aren't part of our culture. A covering at all is the main thing but ideally it's something that's actually part of life. And yeah old women in parishes are a source of great knowledge and information. I'd even ask the priest if he's from the same country.
1ne2c7w,What do you use for veiling?,ndq1xxv,Routine-Message5122,2,"I bought mine at a tiny local shop because Catholicism is not very popular here :( but some veils have bigger patterns on them, so they are not as transparent, if that makes sense‚Ä¶? It‚Äôs a very nit-picky personal opinion, and I had a hard time finding a more solid veil myself."
1ne2c7w,What do you use for veiling?,ndplk1i,Habemus_Username,2,"I think it's also about matching what you'd wear with the appropriate occasion. Hats are usually fascinators and go with a particular outfit rather than a weekly thing. Unless you're going for the 1920s style small hats, even then they might draw attention. There is a trend for younger, late teens-early twenties girls to wear silk scarves and that seems to work quite well too. Especially if it works as part of a cohesive/coherent outfit. Otherwise, just get yourself a veil that you like and just focus on uniting yourself spiritually with Our Lord at mass. Honestly, it'll be fine!"

It's not rare that a recently party appointed bishop sends a letter to the secret church to ask for a valid consecration. In fact, the whole Pope Francis recognizing the CCP Church could be a ""lol the majority of your bishops are secretly with me, you lost, kiss"", in the eyes of this priest.

There are no options like in the Novus Ordo.The Ordinariate liturgy is always celebrated ad orientem. Chants are always traditional. Communion is received on the tongue at the altar rail. There is a clear distinction between Low, High, and Solemn Mass. There are no liturgical abuses. They have Ember Days in their calendar. They retain rich prayers of exorcism for baptisms.

1nbbfgh,Sermon from the Immaculata in St. Marys Kansas 9/7/2025,ndbniph,Willsxyz,1,"**Beginning of transcription for those who (as I do) prefer to read (1/3)**Know you not what the scriptures say of Elias? How he has called on God against Israel? Lord, they have slain thy prophets. They have torn down thy altars. But how does God answer him? I have left 7,000 men that have not bowed their knee to Baal.Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant selected out of grace. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Hhost. Amen. Dear reverend father dear brothers and sisters, dear faithful just a few days ago we celebrated the feast of the venerable patron St. Pius the 10th and I want to speak on the situation in the church today and on the foundation of our beloved society by Archbishop Lefebvre in response to this present crisis.St. Paul says that the things of the Old Testament were written as an example for us for our instruction and correction. So follow this analogy, if you can, that I've made just between the history of the Old Testament kingdom of Israel and Judah and the comparison it bears with the New Testament kingdom of the Catholic Church centered in the papacy in Rome. So first we'll look at the Old Testament history.So after many years of a unified rule that began under King David and lasted until the death of King Solomon, that's when the northern tribes of Israel started to break from the true worship that was in Jerusalem. And they started a false religion, a new worship that included some elements of the true worship, but they mixed it with pagan idolatrous symbols as well, such as the golden calf. And soon these tribes were deported and dispersed amongst all the nations because of their false beliefs and practices.And of course, the true worship continued in the kingdom of Judah, in the city of Jerusalem, in the temple, until a new syncretic religion was developed that combined true elements with false doctrine, which led to an invasion from foreign lands and the deportation of God's people into Babylon. The holy city was left in ruins. The temple was destroyed. The altar of sacrifice was desecrated. The holy vessels necessary for the true worship were stolen. And it was only the severely persecuted prophet Jeremias and a few of the most insignificant people that remained in Jerusalem. because the vast majority including the king and his whole royal house and most of the priesthood were carried away like the wind so that no official or solemn worship could be lawfully practiced until the time of punishment was completed. And then so we see after 70 years of captivity, their descendants, because that first generation passed away in captivity, their descendants began to return back to Jerusalem. The city was rebuilt and the true worship was started again and flourished.So in my analogy which is obviously not de fide, okay, it's just my observation one can see though a true correlation between Protestant northern Europe breaking from the Catholic Church and being carried away in every direction with strange doctrine and worship while the true worship continued in Rome. But then we could see in the 1960s we see a new religion start to emerge after the council involving the priesthood, the prelets of the church, even involving the popes. The churches were liturgically vandalized in the name of the council, sacred vessels and vestments were thrown out. The sacrifice is desacralized with the novus ordo mass. It's no longer sacred and most of the clergy are carried away into doctrines and worship that are foreign to the traditional Catholic faith."
1nbbfgh,Sermon from the Immaculata in St. Marys Kansas 9/7/2025,ndbnpja,Willsxyz,1,"**Continuation of transcription (2/3)**And so we should be very thankful for his excellency Marcel Lefebvre to have the prophetic insight to see what was happening in the church back in the 1960s and 1970s and to take a stand against the changes with a preference for what the church has always believed and taught and practiced and against all these novelties and change which, by the way, are code words for the communist and the modernist. And so he preferred to be firmly attached to eternal Rome instead of being carried away by every wind of doctrine of the day. So let us recall for a moment the reasons why Archbishop Lefebvre named the newly founded religious order after Pope St. Pius 10th. It was a calculated, deliberate and a prayerful choice. I will give you three reasons.Well, first the archbishop explained that since the purpose of the society of St. Pius the 10th is all the works necessary for the formation of the priest. The seminaries must ensure that priestly formation achieve its main goal which is priestly holiness. So the society was placed under the patronage of St. Pius the 10th because his primary concern as pope was the integrity the integrity of the priesthood and the sanctity that flowed from it. So as the priest goes so do the faithful. When the priest is holy the people will generally be holy as well.The second reason, another reason for the name, the present crisis that has poisoned the church since the second Vatican council is the neo-modernist heresy, the synthesis of all heresies and the various secular philosophies that St. Pius the 10th viewed as being incompatible with Catholic dogma. So both he and the archbishop promoted thomistic scholastic theology as the principle philosophical method to be taught which is the antidote for all the poison that is being spewed by these so-called doctors who as St. Pius the 10th said ""although they know many things they don't know anything"".And then third finally since all the self-inflicted destruction that has occurred in the church over the last decade it made good sense to keep with the motto of his pontificate which is to restore all things in Christ.But as we know, the ideas at the heart of liberalism and modernism did find their way into the church and flourished in the aftermath of the council and the council with its application and its interpretation and now virtually dominates the whole entire Catholic world. And the church authorities demand adherence to these new beliefs in the manner of the Pharisees who would throw anyone out of the synagogue if they professed belief that Jesus was the Messiah.Since faith is a supernatural virtue and thus greater than the moral virtue of obedience, the archbishop had to say no. And he describes this act as true obedience by saying, ""Now our disobedience is motivated by the need to keep the Catholic faith. And to be forced to submit to the second Vatican council to the postconcilary reforms, to the acts which are undermining our faith and destroying the church... It is impossible for us to do so. To collaborate in the destruction of the church is to betray the church and to betray our Lord Jesus Christ. So all the great theologians of the past have taught that if the pope by his acts destroys the church, we are not to obey him."""
1nbbfgh,Sermon from the Immaculata in St. Marys Kansas 9/7/2025,ndbnu5z,Willsxyz,1,"**Continuation of transcription (3/3)**And so this is where we find ourselves today. The Catholic Church which has existed for almost two millennia is being replaced by another religion filled with contempt for the sacred and which bears the stamp of vulgarity which will only lead to further lead to the loss of faith and to atheism. The new theology is a syncretistic mixture of socialism and Christianity. And the only real true solution to end this crisis is the same as it was then to return back to the true faith of our fathers and to holiness. And no one can do this without God's grace and without the imitation of our Lord Jesus Christ.So, one last story. Just a few weeks ago, the society of St. Pius the 10th gathered together over 7,000 pilgrims in Rome for the Jubilee year. They they assembled for mass only a few steps away from the Colosseum where thousands of mortars shed their blood for our Lord Jesus Christ. And just as today, in reminiscence of the pantheon of ancient Rome, where everything was tolerated and no false religion was left out, just as long as everyone agreed to burn a few simple grains of incense to all the gods. But the first Christians said no. They would not compromise the truth for a false peace. They would not they would rather lose their life for the true faith in Jesus Christ than to accommodate to the world and to the intolerance that it has for the truth and for the rights of God and for the kingship of our Lord Jesus Christ. And so here we are again today, 2,000 years later, to bear witness to that same faith. The faith that conquered the world, the faith that overcame paganism.Our superior general, Father Pagarani, in his sermon asked this question during that mass. What do we ask of the church and of its hierarchy? We demand the faith. This faith does not take as its mission to conform to the world and to dialogue with it but to convert it to the true and only savior our lord Jesus Christ. We will not bow our knee to Baal. We will not offer incense to the false religions of this world. And this is what we want to bear to those in the Vatican. We want this faith to be pro professed in its entirety. It is this faith that made the lepers well in today's gospel.The city of Rome has been invaded, occupied, pillaged, burned many times, but it always seems to rise again. And so can the church because it is divinely founded by our Lord who could restore it even if it's even at a period of 70 years, which we're even coming close to that in just a few years. You figure the 1960s to about 2030, that's about 70 years. And the this can even coincide with the anniversary of the 2,000-year anniversary of our savior's passion and resurrection from the dead. So maybe we could see in our lifetimes the church rising out of its ashes as well. We can only hope and pray and just let events run their course according to divine providence. I'll close with a verse here from the Athanasian creed:""Whoever wishes to be saved, it is necessary above all that he hold to the Catholic faith. Which faith, unless it is kept whole and undefiled, without a doubt, he will most surely perish. This is the Catholic faith which unless a man believes it faithfully and firmly, he cannot be saved.""In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen."

1nba17y,What to do during Low Mass,nd7utg0,Cathain78,1,"I found attending Sung Mass (Missa Cantata) more beneficial for learning when I first started attending the TLM. And of course, it‚Äôs the same Mass just with more parts audible which helps you understand where you are in the Mass, which makes it easier to understand the structure.  Once you know where the Kyrie, Gloria, Gospel, Credo, Preface, Sanctus, Pater Noster, Agnes Dei, Communion, Last Gospel are (as you will stand and often join in at those points in the Sung Mass), then you can use them as sign posts and start to follow the Missal and work out where the Priest is at other times around those parts (eg. Introit, Collect, Epistle, Gradual, Offetory, Canon, etc). Once you start to memorise the Ordinary of the Mass which are repeated unchanged each time, and then understand the basic structure of the Mass in relation to them, then you can do less flicking back and forward in the Missal and concentrate on the Propers for that day. Personally I don‚Äôt usually check the Epistle or Gospel because our priest will read them again in the vernacular prior to his homily.For me, getting to know the Mass this way was easiest. After that. Low Mass made more sense once I understood the structure, even though the kneeling, sitting and standing change and much is inaudible.  Getting a missal or guide which notes when to sit, kneel and stand during High and Low Mass is also useful in helping you find where you are in the Mass.This is assuming you want to follow along with the Mass. I prefer to do so, and as someone else said - Pope St Pius X also recommended this way.  However it‚Äôs not absolutely necessary. You can pray privately or say the rosary. The Mass is still effective in doing its work and obtaining graces for you. Unlike the Novus Ordo which is very much a crowd participation event, the TLM is done through the priest acting on your behalf and simply praying reverently and earnestly at the foot of the cross is enough."

1nag5kv,Vernacular TLM?,ncvav6f,Filipino_Thomist1999,17,Archbishop Lefebvre said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have the Traditional Mass in French than the Novus Ordo in Latin.‚ÄùSo it‚Äôs not an issue of language. It‚Äôs an issue of doctrine.
1nag5kv,Vernacular TLM?,ncu5ja3,Willsxyz,14,"If the traditional mass were celebrated in the vernacular then any priest whatsoever would be capable of celebrating that mass. All you have to do is read the book and follow the instructions, which would be in the vernacular. So the second part of your hypothetical situation doesn't make any sense.Apart from that, I am sure the SSPX would welcome such a move, because it would, at a stroke, resolve all of the serious problems with the new mass. That doesn't mean however, that they would stop celebrating the mass in Latin and, indeed, no Pope would ever say that the mass must be celebrated in the vernacular because Trent anathematized the proposition that the mass be celebrated only in the vernacular."

1nag5kv,Vernacular TLM?,ncx43ob,SomeoneinHistory,2,Most likely they are pertaining to resources on vestments and even altars since it is an unfortunate fact that a lot of parishes have terrible architecture where the tabernacle has been disfigured by being relegated to the side instead of the center where it must be.

1nag5kv,Vernacular TLM?,ncwpimq,Willsxyz,3,"I disagree that this should have happened in the 1960s, since the Second Vatican council never asked for the mass to be celebrated in the vernacular, but rather asked that the faithful be taught to say the parts appropriate to them in Latin.However now that the novus ordo disaster has already occurred, it would make sense to allow the traditional mass to be celebrated in the vernacular as a replacement of the new mass."
1nag5kv,Vernacular TLM?,ncy5a1y,Miserable_Key_7552,2,"As a member of the Anglican Communion who‚Äôs had the chance to attend an amazing Saturday vigil Mass at an Anglican Ordinariate parish, their use of the Roman Rite is very beautiful and comforting in its similarities with the prayer book tradition I‚Äôve grown fond of as an Anglican. However, the English Missal might be a more fitting representation of the Tridentine Mass in English, as it was published as a nearly direct translation of the Tridentine Mass into Elizabethan English by early 20th century Anglo-Catholics. It‚Äôs never been a super common choice, even amongst die hard Anglo-Catholics, but I‚Äôve heard that both St. Clements Episcopal Church Philadelphia, and the Episcopal Church of the Resurrection NYC still use the English Missal, so that could be a good place to look to see what an English rendition of it might look like."
1nag5kv,Vernacular TLM?,ncy0ji1,Willsxyz,5,"The traditional mass can be celebrated with the ugly vestments and table altars currently existing in novus ordo parishes. It would not be ideal, but it can be done and would be a huge improvement over the new mass using the same vestments and altars."

They were most definitely good and holy people, but do they deserve the title of saint? Hmm, we cannot know for certain. We must trust that God knows and pray for them. If they are in heaven then they will receive our petitions - if they are not, then they will receive our prayers to help them pass through purgatory.There is a definite desire, and I had a long chat with an SSPX priest at a pub in Nottingham about this, to canonise the second Vatican council, so the church can make an argument of ""look at how many saints it produced"". I don't buy this. I think the church is playing politics.In these times, it is prudent to trust in tradition and keep your head down. As many faithful have done over the centuries."

This ceremony, which is apparently done against the will of Rome, is in no way a schism. We are not schismatics! If an excommunication was pronounced against the bishops of China, who separated themselves from Rome and put themselves under the Chinese government, one very easily understands why Pope Pius XII excommunicated them. There is no question of us separating ourselves from Rome, nor of putting ourselves under a foreign government, nor of establishing a sort of parallel church as the Bishops of Palmar de Troya have done in Spain. They have even elected a pope, formed a college of cardinals... It is out of the question for us to do such things.

1n656ix,Confusion about the SSPX,nbxxar4,SomeoneinHistory,15,"Commenting on the second point of LatinLatin was the lingua franca of the West which was the jurisdiction of the Pope during the Age of the Pentarchy and so it was only natural for Latin to become the language of the Church in Rome.Today no single culture can claim Latin and because of that the Church sees it as a sign of unity and harmony because it equally belongs to all Catholics.Not Roman, not Greek, not Syrian, not Ruthenian, not Chalcedonian, but all Catholics.Further because of how set apart it is from modern culture, Latin is in a similar role to how Hebrew was for Israel because it is solely intended for worship.Just as the East gravitated towards Greek as its sacred language, the West was guided towards Latin not because it was superior to other languages but because Latin became the universal bond of unity throughout the Universal Church.In Veterum Sapientia(1962) by Pope St. John XXIII:"" Of its very nature, Latin is most suitable for promoting every form of culture among peoples. It gives rise to no jealousies, it does not favor any one nation, but presents itself with equal impartiality to all and is equally acceptable to all.""So, while Our Lord Jesus Christ used and sanctified the four languages of Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, and Latin, the Holy Spirit led the Church to choose Latin as the universal sacred tongue of Rome for unity and clarity."
1n656ix,Confusion about the SSPX,nbxplrp,Fallen-Monk83,13,"To point 1: why would God allow anything bad to happen? Not trying to be a smart aleck by answering your question with a question, but that's the way I see it. In this world, less than ideal things happen. that's just the reality of it. Point 2: Honestly, i'm not the most educated on this matter. I know traditionally, the church used Latin and it is important in that aspect. Hopefully someone more knowledgeable than me can answer that. Point 3: As a Catholic, you believe that the Catholic Church is the church that Christ instructed St. Peter to build (Matthew 16:18) Also adding that ""the gates of hell shall never prevail against it"". For that reason, Catholics put their faith in that promise even when the Church is going through times of division and turmoil that it is not lost. As such, leaving the church isn't viable. Hope this helps."

I can provide personal insight to the Latin. One of the big draws for me to join the Church was the thought that I could go to Mass anywhere in the world and be able to participate. Also, there is something about Latin that, once you learn the prayers in Latin, you never forget them. I often find myself praying in Latin when I‚Äôm stressed or need guidance. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs the universal language, but those are some benefits. You are fortunate that you are near an SSPX priest.

Most places had a low mass with 4 hymns, the priest would garble through the mass (given that most of it wasn't audible, he could do this). Sermons would be either non-existent, parish notifications/requests for donations or long rambling diatribes about bliz-blaz and him-ham to a largely indifferent congregation who would just be reciting their rosaries. In short, the Tridentine Mass was a pearl thrown before swine. I think the situation we find ourselves in now, with respect to the Old Rite, is very much a better place. Better that it be insulated against people who say it with no care, or those who treat it irreverently. * Regarding the use of Latin - this isn't the gripe of many traditional Catholics. Our main issue isn't the use of a particular language, but how the new mass was a stark departure from what went before. Certainly where I live, those of us who are traditionalists who don't have the confidence to go to the SSPX, often end up attending the Ordinariate Use, which is the Tridentine Mass translated into English. It isn't so much about the language but the intent. Pray in Latin, pray in Greek, pray in Aramaic, pray in English. It's about the substance and intent. A heartfelt prayer in the proper form in the vernacular is much more important to Our Lord than many hundreds of mumbled, half understood Latin prayers.This being said, Latin binds us together as **Roman** Catholics. It is fitting that as Roman Catholics, we should use the shared liturgy and culture of our faith. Just as Greek Catholics use Greek! It brings us together. In the past, it meant that people from diverse origins could all worship together and all hold an equal understanding of the faith. A point to remember is that Greek was the language of the Roman Empire. Latin was the language of Rome.* On fidelity to RomeWe must hold to this position. Our alternative is to embrace Protestantism - which we can't do. We hold our fidelity to the Modern church out of compassion. Like a family member who is going through a rough phase and doing things we don't approve of. We don't abandon them, we walk with them, giving an example of what they should do, but also being a helping hand up when they eventually realise the gravity of what they are doing/have done. We are Roman Catholics."
1n656ix,Confusion about the SSPX,nc09us2,kawaqcosta,2,"I have a personal consideration regarding the liturgical language. Of course, the liturgy was initially constructed with the listeners' understanding in mind, beyond the worship of God. However, once the liturgy is crystallized in a certain form, with specific prayers and rites, I believe it is very difficult to make substantial changes to it, including the liturgical language used. The main point is not so much the listener's understanding as the worship offered to God through the liturgy, maintaining it as it was received.Another, related consideration is that, even if the liturgy is composed in what was initially a vernacular language, it gradually de-vulgarizes and becomes less comprehensible to speakers over time. This is notable for Latin, as it has become a dead language, but it also occurs to some extent with Eastern languages. Their ancient forms are not identical to modern forms, although they retain some intelligibility, to a greater or lesser degree.This is my general impression of the history of the liturgy."

The documents of Vatican II contains ‚Äúquestionable‚Äù statements, seemingly at odds with traditional Catholic doctrine. This can be easily explained by the fact that the council declared no dogma and anathematized no error. That is, its declarations are fallible.2. There are good reasons to use Latin in the liturgy but actually the language of mass is a minor issue. At the moment, traditional Catholics have to cling to Latin because 1) there are no approved translations of the traditional mass in vernacular languages and 2) since Vatican II the use of the vernacular has been abused to alter the sense of the text of the mass in order to obscure or eliminate the Catholic doctrine of the mass as dogmatized at Trent.3. To break communion with the bishop of Rome is to leave the one Church that Christ founded. There is one Church, one Faith, one Baptism and not two or three or more Churches. And that one Church founded by Christ is the Catholic Church whose visible head is the bishop of Rome."

Most people I know, including myself, are either former Protestants or Novus Ordo attendees.  Not only were we NOT looked down upon, but in fact the SSPX Priests were nothing but compassionate in both understanding differences and in taking the time and effort to make a logical case for the deficiencies of the New Mass (and Protestant ""traditions"").Real respect for differences means acknowledging them truthfully and addressing them. The SSPX merely refuses to settle for deficiencies in the Latin Rite, and doesn't accept the line that the NO and the VO/TLM ""are the same rite."" It has absolutely nothing to do with the parishioners. These deficiencies do not result in the invalidity of the Eucharist, though they do pose a danger to the laity; a fact which is undeniable statistically and corroborated anecdotally.I hope, if you ever believed that the SSPX and/or her Parishioners are driven by pride or pretension, that you disabuse yourself of that false notion immediately.

One can believe the Novus Ordo is deficient and dangerous, also believe that it is still technically valid, and believe that the Churchmen who attend should not be judged for what they genuinely believe to be an act of obedience. In point of fact, this is overwhelmingly the position of both the SSPX clergy as well as the laymen.We see Novus Ordo Catholics as Catholics who are being underserved by a Church establishment that sold out for Modernism. The issue is with the Church as an institution and with the errors that is has promulgated. Being a Catholic in the main Church is like playing on hard mode.

That authority simply ends where the errors begin, and *only* where these errors are espoused. The position of the SSPX is that these Popes are still the Pope, which is why we pray for the Pope during the Mass. Presumably these Popes performed these miracles because God gave them the grace to do so. Much as he gave St. Peter the power to walk on water and heal countless sick people, even though Peter also denied Christ several times and was a notable Judaizer, which is an early heresy for which he was rebuked by St. Paul. God gives us graces according to our station, but nobody has the authority to be mistaken - not even the first Pope. But God's grace is not all or nothing, and he works with imperfect people, even imperfect Popes.Incidentally, on a related note, this is also the reason that we see Eucharistic miracles in hosts consecrated in the Novus Ordo. It's because it really is the Body of Christ. But the SSPX makes no claims to the contrary.Personally I think it's pretty clear that most people that criticize the SSPX are criticizing an accidental strawman.To your second question, I discovered the SSPX church when it sent a mission to my rural and mostly Protestant area, and showed me that there are still Catholic Priests out there who did not succumb to the insufferably boomer outcomes of the cultural revolution - Priests who traveled literal hours every week at great personal expense for the care of souls. Long story short, were it not for the SSPX, I would not be Catholic. I truly believe this organization deserves credit for growing the flock at a time when the NO church is frankly collapsing in the West, and they are doing it by being genuine.

The Conciliar Church is a trend inside the one Catholic Church, and everybody's influenced by this trend.I firmly believe that SSPX's current actions are just, and that Lefebvre did right in 1970, 1976 and 1988, but one shouldn't create too much of a dichotomy between the Pope and SSPX, as SSPX exists only as an organ of the Church, not the most perfect or useful, but of the ones whom necessity is the highest for our human eyes, and for this reason SSPX isn't against the Pope, but here to help the Pope, whereas in a particular way that could lead to confusion if we forget that all of this is perfectly guided by God through grace."

In Lourdes itself, the FSSP and SSPX churches are overflowing on Sundays. The basilicas have a lot of people too, but proportionally to their size, the Latin Mass parishes attract more people. In villages around the country, it's a catastrophe. Village parishes are closed on many Sundays of the year due to low attendance.

1mqri0t,Why can‚Äôt you go to NO?,n8tn0b7,Willsxyz,13,"None of the answers so far reflect the SSPX position on the matter. The best source of information about this is the SSPX‚Äôs own videos on the topic. They shouldn‚Äôt be hard to search up on Youtube.To giver an extremely brief summary, every reference to distinctively Catholic doctrine was removed from the novus ordo mass (most notably the idea of the mass as a propitiatory sacrifice) in order to make it acceptable to protestants.The SSPX says that this makes the novus ordo mass a danger to the Catholic faith, since the Catholic doctrine of the mass as described at Trent has been stripped out of the mass. They then argue that a mass that represents a danger to the faith cannot be obligatory for Catholics.This argument does not seem to support the avoidance of traditional masses offered by other groups, but some people argue (not an official position of the SSPX) that the ordinations of novus ordo and ‚Äúecclesia dei‚Äù priests are doubtful and that therefore one should avoid traditional masses celebrated by them also."
1mqri0t,Why can‚Äôt you go to NO?,n8tb65k,Internal_Ad1735,17,"We're not just being moody about guitars and felt banners. The NO (‚ÄúNovus Ordo‚Äù Mass) is kinda... meh. Too casual. Sometimes the priest treats it more like a hangout, music is cringe, prayers feel rushed or made up. Mass is a glimpse into heaven, not a community talent show. Most trads are worried that the watered-down vibe & loose liturgical rules could mess with our faith (or our kids‚Äô faith), so they‚Äôd rather skip than end up spiritually confused, frustrated, or scandalized. This is also the SSPX's position.Church says, unless you‚Äôre sick, caring for someone, or traveling without options‚Äîyou gotta go to Mass on Sunday. It's a big deal. Some trads will say: ‚ÄúIf the only option is an irreverent, possibly sketchy NO that drives me nuts or risks my soul, better to stay home and pray hard.‚Äù Others say, ‚ÄúSuck it up, go, just don‚Äôt receive Communion if you‚Äôre really uncomfortable.‚Äù*What if there‚Äôs ICKSP or FSSP, but no SSPX?*Oh, that‚Äôs the jackpot (for me personally)! They do old-school Latin Mass, the whole reverence package. If you got those in town, you win‚Äîno controversy, no drama. Fulfills your obligation and gives you the spiritual experience you want.My opinion : if there's ANY valid Catholic Mass (NO, TLM, Byzantine, whatever)‚Äîgo. Only skip if you absolutely can‚Äôt, and ideally, only if your confessor/priest says it‚Äôs OK in super rare cases.ICKSP, SSPX, and FSSP: Full-on trad, fully legit, absolutely go if you can.Don‚Äôt let pride or ideology make you cut yourself off from the sacraments. Jesus is bigger than liturgical drama.Honestly, in the end: Go to Mass. If you can pick, pick the most reverent one. If you hate your local Mass, get creative, travel, or find the least painful option. But don‚Äôt ghost God on Sunday‚ÄîHe‚Äôs waiting to see you!"
1mqri0t,Why can‚Äôt you go to NO?,n8swgat,WinterBaroness,10,"There's SSPX videos on yt which explain that topic, but basically the new Mass was created in favor of protestants so there are a lot of elements which are missing or have been substituted for more protestant things (for example to usage of a table instead of an altar, which makes the Mass feel like a meal). And also, not sure if it's catechism or canon law, but you are dispensed from going to Mass if that could harm your faith, so that applies if you live in an area with only the New Mass.Meanwhile, on the second topic, yes I'd go to a non-SSPX Latin Mass but I know there might be people here who might not agree with me, since FSSP was created as a Vatican II-aprooved Latin Mass group. But my opinion is that any traditional Mass matters, what people tell me about is to be wary sometimes of the homilies which could be pro-Vatican Ii"
1mqri0t,Why can‚Äôt you go to NO?,n94jhlo,almeidathecatholic,3,"Hail Mary, dearest.There we go. The Novus Ordo Missae is the worship of men and not the worship of Our Lord! Faith has been relativized, the Holy Eucharist is treated as a banquet, the Holy Mass through this profane liturgy is diminished as a liturgy performed for thanksgiving. It is the result of disobedience between God and man, totally ignoring the Sacred Tradition and disrespecting the lex orandi and lex credendi that make up the Holy Mother Church. Its liturgical structure goes completely against what the Church has always said. In the third canon of the twentieth and second session of the Council of Trent it says the following: Canon III ‚Äì If anyone says that the sacrifice of the Mass is only a sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; or that it is a mere commemoration of the finished sacrifice on the cross, but not a propitiatory sacrifice; or that it benefits only the one who receives it; and that it should not be offered by the living and the dead for sins, pains, satisfactions and other needs; be anathema.(Council of Trent, July 15th MDLXII ‚Äî XXI Session, Canon III) It is a total disrespect for the Most Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and the most important dogma declared by the Holy Church, the Holy Mass of Always.In the year 1570, Saint Pius V through his bull Quo Primum Tempore declared the Holy Mass of Always as incorruptible and irreplaceable, as he says according to sections 6, 11 and 14 of the same. Saint Pius V also in Quo Primum Tempore dogmatically proclaimed that this Mass can be celebrated without restrictions or prohibitions, as he says in session no. 7.Pope Paul VI himself stated the disrespect for this dogma in his letter Missale Romanum written by him at the Second Vatican Council.This is what Paul VI said: ""The Roman Missal which, in accordance with the decree of the Tridentine Council, was promulgated in 1570 by our predecessor Saint Pius V, is counted among the many and admirable fruits that that Holy Synod spread throughout the Church of Christ. In fact, for four centuries, the priests of the Latin rite had it as a norm for the celebration of the Eucharistic sacrifice, and the holy heralds of the Gospel introduced it to almost the entire earth. In it also many Saints copiously nourished their piety towards God, drawing it both from readings of Holy Scripture and from their prayers, the main part of which was organized by Saint Gregory the Great.But, since the desire to promote the sacred liturgy began to grow and strengthen among the Christian people - a desire that, according to the words of our venerable predecessor Pius XII, must be considered a favorable sign of Divine Providence towards the people of our time and a salutary passage of the Holy Spirit through his Church - it became evident that the formulas of the Roman Missal should be restored and enriched.""(Pope Paul VI, 1969 ‚Äî Missale Romanum, Second Vatican Council)A dogma is a truth of faith that cannot be tampered with, much less denied, so do not accept a profane rite such as the Novus Ordo Missae.I hope you understand, my dear.

But in my case I remember in Portuguese Masses, instead of doing a Confiteor, the priest asks us to generally confess our sins to God in our minds, so it's just a few seconds of (somewhat awkward) silence. Update: So I just checked and that usually is what is done on Years B and C; Year A is the most similar to the Tridentine Mass one but still there are names of Saints missing.I'll just send you a Latin version I translated from ChatGPT and check with the Latin Mass their differences: Confiteor Deo omnipotenti, et vobis, fratres, quia peccavi nimis cogitatione, verbo et opere: mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.

1mnvj62,Question about music,n8cmya3,Far-Air3908,2,"Music is a tough one, because we‚Äôre all different in how we react to it. Outside of traditional hymns and chants, I listen to metal for the most part. If you avoid the edge-lordy satanic stuff in metal, then it‚Äôs actually an amazing genre, filled with tons of creativity and great song structure.Many songs speak on things such as corruption, unjust war, and the human condition, with many bands doing so in philosophical ways.The problem with metal is it can arouse specific emotions if you‚Äôre not careful. It varies from person to person. It calms me down ironically, because there‚Äôs just something about guitar work and masterfully crafted riffs that ease me when I‚Äôm anxious. Just be careful with what you listen to, and if a band says negative things about anything regarding our faith, cut it out."
1mnvj62,Question about music,n8kolzu,EducationalTip3093,2,I feel it mostly has to do with the lyrics of the songs and not just that type of music in general so if it is like classical music or music with no lyrics it is probably safe to listen to but mostly it has to do with if the song is leading you to temptation or not

1mnvj62,Question about music,n8blntc,undeadcookie123,1,"Apologies since I didn't answer your question directly, but it seems to me that since you have heard what Fr. Ripperger has to say, and assuming that you're somewhat familiar with Dr. Kwasniewski's opinion on music, you will continue to struggle to find music that doesn't endanger your soul at all, as that kind of music is hard to come by these days. My suggestion would be to allow the truth to transform your desires, which would free you from the burden you are carrying at the moment. But, on a practical note, older 20th century music is a lot more likely to be safe to listen to. Sorry that I can't give you any recommendations off the top of my head.

1mmn5t2,Questions about your views on women,n7yr9cx,Fallen-Monk83,13,"Speaking for myself personally, I don't particuarly hold those views. Nor do I know anyone that does. For example, I have never had someone irl tell me that women shouldn't go to university or have a job, etc. Honestly, I see a lot more people complaining about these ""trad cath"" views than I see trad caths actually espousing them."
1mmn5t2,Questions about your views on women,n8pr9vx,Internal_Ad1735,3,"Okay, so first off ‚Äî a lot of this stuff gets exaggerated online. The *real* thinking isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwomen = no brain, stay in kitchen,‚Äù it‚Äôs more like ‚ÄúGod set up men and women differently, and the family is the central thing society rests on.‚Äù Everything else in trad thought kind of flows from that.  **On women working / going to uni:**  No one‚Äôs saying women can‚Äôt ever have a job or go to college ‚Äî it‚Äôs about priorities. Ideally, you set up life so that when kids come, mom can be home with them. That‚Äôs not because she‚Äôs ‚Äúless‚Äù than her husband ‚Äî it‚Äôs because kids actually *need* both parents, and moms usually have a special touch in early formation. But yes, in the real world? Rent, groceries, inflation ‚Äî sometimes a wife works, and that‚Äôs fine if it‚Äôs necessary. It‚Äôs more ‚Äúthis is the ideal‚Äù than ‚Äúor else you‚Äôre sinning.‚Äù  **On pants vs skirts:**  The anti-pants thing comes from a mix of modesty concerns and the idea that men and women should dress distinctly. Deuteronomy 22:5 - not wearing clothes of the opposite sex, but also ‚Äî historically, pants were a man thing, skirts/dresses a woman thing. That‚Äôs just the visual line in the sand. And yes, the 50s aesthetic gets romanticized, but it‚Äôs not *about* the 50s. It‚Äôs about keeping clothing modest, feminine, and respectful. If you rock a long, loose, modest pair of pants, you‚Äôre probably not scandalizing anyone, but some trads still just prefer the skirt standard as a rule.  **On ‚Äúwife or nun‚Äù:**  In the Catholic worldview, your life is meant to be a gift ‚Äî either to your spouse/kids in marriage or to God directly in religious life. The ‚Äúcareer-focused single person‚Äù thing is culturally normal now but doesn‚Äôt have a theological foundation. Not saying you can‚Äôt be single for a long time ‚Äî some people never meet the right person or discern religious life ‚Äî but in trad thinking, permanent ‚Äúme first, no commitments‚Äù isn‚Äôt the goal.  **On the nostalgia for the past:**  It‚Äôs not about thinking the 50s were perfect. Those decades just happened to still have a culture that lined up more with Catholic social teaching ‚Äî intact families, faith in the public square, local communities that actually functioned. SSPX people look at that and say, ‚ÄúSee, that‚Äôs closer to what works‚Äù compared to what we‚Äôve got now.  It‚Äôs not ‚Äúwomen bad, men king‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs ‚Äúmen and women both have a mission, and society works better when those roles complement each other like they‚Äôre designed to.‚Äù Everything else, like skirts or staying home, is an application of that principle."
1mmn5t2,Questions about your views on women,n80kcyy,craft00n,5,"Hi. French trad cath and philosophy student here. You're 100% right IMO.1. Mothers should be as clever as possible, because being it's a perfection that's very valuable for the children.2. The problem with trousers is about modesty and distinction : women and men should simply dress in a modest way, with garments clearly distinguishing between men and women.3. In marriage, men and women are here to take care of the children and each other. Usually, it's done with a working husband and an at home mom, but the only rule is ""what is best for the children"".Us trad caths are very deeply influenced by rigid protestantism. As an example, they are overly attached to young earth creationism (100% prot theory, traditional catholic teaching isn't like that), and it's also visible through the rigidity of some social norms."
1mmn5t2,Questions about your views on women,n7yxpga,Admirable-Mud443,4,"As a woman who attends a large Sspx parish, I have plenty of firsthand experience with people who hold the extreme views you mentioned. It seems to me that there are certain people who warp the traditions and rules of the Faith into something it‚Äôs not. Unfortunately this can happen with any worldview or religion, where people use misinterpreted facets of it and use it as an excuse to behave poorly. To my understanding of the Catholic faith, it‚Äôs about balance, which can be more difficult to see clearly in the modern world. For example, there is nothing in our Faith that says it is sinful to live a single life. However, there are more graces that can be obtained through the sacraments of Marriage and Holy orders (priesthood), and the idea is that either of these vocations create a defined path to guide us to the ultimate goal of Heaven. The Church does not teach that it is sinful for women to work or go to school, but oftentimes it is seen as preferable for women to focus on giving all of her energy to raising children while in the season of motherhood. Contrary to how extreme ‚Äútrads‚Äù, and those of the opposite side of the spectrum think of it, putting our all into our children should use our full intellect, rather than neglect it."

1mmn5t2,Questions about your views on women,n7zw84y,SnowWhiteFeather,1,"Lets set tradition aside for a moment and talk about hormones. Men and women are different. We have different hormones that change our cognition.""Estrogen significantly influences cognition, generally enhancing functions like memory and executive processing by acting on brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. It particularly supports verbal memory and can improve learning and memory performance. Higher lifetime estrogen exposure is linked to lower risk of cognitive decline, with benefits in memory, reasoning, and neurogenesis. However, in older postmenopausal women, effects may be neutral or absent, especially with short-term hormone therapy or combined progestogens, and declining levels during menopause can impair sleep, mood, and cognitive performance.Yes, estrogen impacts nervousness (anxiety). Stable or higher levels, particularly estradiol, reduce anxiety-like behaviors and subjective anxiety by modulating stress responses and enhancing brain inhibition. Low estrogen increases vulnerability to anxiety, mood disorders, and conditions like PTSD, while fluctuations (e.g., during menstrual cycles or stress) can heighten nervousness, depression, and emotional dysregulation. Hormone replacement therapy may alleviate anxiety in some cases, though results vary.Estrogen also affects attention, improving selective attention and reducing impairments in attention-related tasks, especially under stress or cognitive challenges, leading to better focus and cognitive speed."" ‚ÄìGrok""Estrogen levels decrease sharply after childbirth. During pregnancy, estrogen (especially estradiol) rises significantly to support fetal development and other changes. After delivery, particularly after the placenta is expelled (a major estrogen source), levels drop rapidly within hours to days, returning to pre-pregnancy or near-menopausal levels. This can contribute to mood changes, cognitive shifts, and increased anxiety. Breastfeeding may keep estrogen suppressed longer due to elevated prolactin, which inhibits ovarian estrogen production."" ‚ÄìGrokBefore childbirth estrogen makes women feminine. After childbirth we see a drop in estrogen that makes a mother more nervous and have a diffuse attention. This is great for taking care of a young child and protecting them from danger.Even newborns have different neurochemical responses to mothers and fathers. How a child relates to each parent is special and unique. A father cannot occupy the role of a mother and a mother cannot occupy the role of a father.If a child does not get to have a relationship with their mother and father they are losing something that they were meant to have. If the parents ‚Äìparticulairly the mother‚Äì aren't the primary caregiver for a child until roughly the age of four or five that child is losing something that they were meant to have.A mother and father have a unique responsibility towards children and the relationship that parents have with their children means that they care significantly more than any other caregiver about fulfilling the needs that a child has. You also learn the cues or language that each child has, which makes you more responsive. The habits and patterns that you learn also let you address problems before they fully manifest. This intimacy of parenthood can't be replaced by daycare.Given Church teaching on contraceptives and what science and reason tell us about a mothers role in childcare there isn't a lot of room for a career and an education is a significant financial burden.If a woman wants to be educated it may be a financial obstacle to motherhood. If a mother wants to have a career it is probably an injustice to her children.It is a tough choice for some people. It is an easier choice when mothers are shown respect and dignity for the incredibly important role that they fulfill in raising well adjusted and flourishing children.So what about work and pants?People need purpose. If a woman doesn't have children she needs to be occupied with a purpose and a job can provide that. Education can fill that purpose too. Though good judgement should be excercised, because some jobs have a lot of interaction with vulgar and degrading people. Higher education can be a particularly terrible environment both in terms of culture and ideology.Pants can be modest. However, dresses are beautiful and feminine. As Catholics we should desire to present ourselves well as children of God. Catholic men and women should both be distinguished in our behavior and by extension our clothing."

1mmn5t2,Questions about your views on women,n7zzyd7,SnowWhiteFeather,0,"I would also add that having one working partner is easier than you would expect. In cases where it isn't possible marriage might need to be put off until the finances can accomodate.Daycare costs usually eat up most of one parents income when both parents work.If both husband and wife work or get an education until marriage they should either have savings or a higher earning potential. If they wait until marriage to start having children they should be reasonably well established before their expenses increase. If they live at home until marriage they should be able to save even more. If they have family or community support it will cut down on costs because they will have access to secondhand toys, furniture, clothes, and have more access to trusted babysitters who will ask for much less.Children and having a stay at home wife is mostly about priorities though. Most people aren't willing to make the sacrafices, but that doesn't mean that they couldn't.As an additional perk having a stay at home wife often means that meal quality is better and that more energy can be put into raising children.Well behaved children are much less stressful and demanding. They are more pleasant to be around and learn how to contribute to the household at a significantly earlier age, which in turn allows the children to feel like they are valuable and capable."

The good texts have served as cover to get those texts which are snares, equivocal, and denuded of meaning, accepted and passed.‚Äù (fromI Accuse the Council)‚ÄúWe believe we can affirm, purely by internal and external criticism ofVatican II, i.e. by analyzing the texts and studying the Council‚Äôs ins and outs, that by turning its back on Tradition and breaking with the Church of the past,it is a schismatic council.‚Äù(Archbishop Lefebvre,Le Figaro, August 4, 1976)‚ÄúIt is stupefying to read in theDocumentation Catholiquethat the Lutheran-Catholic Commission of the Secretariat for Christian Unity, and thus an official Roman commission, said in effect that numerous points in the Council were drawn from the teachings of Luther‚Ä¶‚Äù(Conference in Germany, October 29, 1984)‚ÄúSome say the Council was good and has good,but only the reform is bad.

It comes from heresy and results in heresy, even if all its acts are not formally heretical. It is thus impossible for any faithful Catholic who is aware of these things to adopt this reform, or to submit to it in any way at all.To ensure our salvation, the only attitude of fidelity to the Church and to Catholic doctrine, is a categorical refusal to accept the reform. ... That is why we hold fast to all that has been believed and practiced in the faith, morals, liturgy, teaching of the catechism, formation of the priest and institution of the Church, by the Church of all time;to all these things as codified in those books which saw day before the Modernist influence of the Council.‚Äù (Declarationof Faith, November 21, 1974)‚ÄúWe can think that there is Rome and Rome: [on one hand,] there is the Rome which is eternal in Her Faith, Her Dogmas, Her concept of the Sacrifice of the Mass; [on the other hand,]there is the temporal Rome which is influenced by the ideas of the modern world, an influence which the Council itself did not escape.‚Äù (October 13, 1974)‚ÄúThe Church, in the course of the 1960's, thusduring the Council, acquired values that have come from outside the Church, from the liberal culture -due secoli- from two centuries of liberal culture. It is clear:these are the ""rights"" of man, it is religious freedom, it is ecumenism. It is Satanic.‚Äù (Conference, December 13, 1984)""Without rejecting this Council wholesale,I think that it is the greatest disaster of this century and of all the past centuries, since the founding of the Church."" The AngelusA Matter of Principle‚ÄúI never‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt accept the Council! Because you are destroying the Catholic State in the name of the Council!It is sure! It is evident!‚Ä¶This Council gives the same rights to error as to Truth!That is impossible‚Ä¶This new faith, it is a new religion. It is a protestant religion. That is a fact!How is it possible that the Pope gives the authorization to this change? How it is possible that the pope can sign this constitution (on liturgical change)? It is a deep mystery‚Ä¶If I take the position of the Council, I am betraying my Mother Church.‚Äù (Archbishop Lefebvre, conference, 1976)We [Bishop de Castro Mayer and the Archbishop] fought together to preventthe errors of Liberalism, which are a cancer in the doctrine of the Church, spreading themselves in the texts of the Council. ... Unfortunately, this Liberal principle has been adopted by Vatican II. ...If one does not want to believe that these texts are Liberal, one has just to see the consequences: ecumenism (all religion on an equal footing), and the laicization of the states.Ordination Sermon 1988And, so I said to him [Cardinal Ratzinger], ""What is the source of these bad fruits? For me,it is the Councilofaggiornamento; that signifies the Council of the changes. What changes?Changes in the sacraments, changes in catechisms, changes in the Bible, so that we are no longer Catholics [but] are like Protestants. ... And he said, ""No! No, no, no, that does not come from the Council; it comes from bad interpretations of the Council; it comes from abuses of the reforms."" I said, ""That is not true.That comes from the new orientation of the Church in the Council, especially by ecumenism.""Changes in the Sacraments...We are like Protestants 1985‚ÄúIt is stupefying to read in the Documentation Catholique that the Lutheran-Catholic Commission of the Secretariat for Christian Unity, and thus an official Roman commission, said in effect thatnumerous points in the Council were drawn from the teachings of Luther‚Ä¶‚Äù (Conference in Germany, October 29, 1984)The Church has always dreaded novelties, even in her vocabulary and that is why she has held on so strongly to the Latin language in the principal form of Tradition, viz. the Roman Church.For it is by a tendency to novelty that heresies, schisms, and errors have come about.This spirit of novelty, mutation, and change has succeeded in entering into the Church. It necessarily tends to destroy Tradition.The Second Vatican Council, which wished to be the Council of ""up-dating,"" opened the door to this spirit of change and novelty.(Principles and Directives -1982 General Chapter)‚ÄúThe Council should have been the occasion of the reaffirmation of the Truth of the Church and the necessity of the social reign of Jesus and Mary against the errors of Protestantism and Teilhardian naturalism and against socialism and communism. Ordinary Protestants would have been converteden masse. They were disposed to it and their debacle was profound on the eve of the Council.But the Modernists, traitors to the Church, used the Council to favor their compromise with all the modern errors, profiting from a weak pope and a pope disposed to radical changes.All of the commentators on the Council recognize the triumph of the liberals who did not hide their satisfaction and who neutralized or drove from the Roman Curia all of the conservatives and who took the reins of government, centralizing power in the Secretariat of State in order to be certain of managing the ecumenical revolution so much desired by the enemies of the Church. The work was quickly carried out in all fields.Destruction also followed quickly. In this pastoral Council the spirit of error and lies was able to work at its ease, placing time-bombs everywhere which, in due course, would destroy the institutions.(Principles and Directives -1982 General Chapter)"

1mfevl4,What Is a Layman Supposed to Do When No One Will Answer?,n6ldcko,Piklikl,3,"I think you‚Äôre blowing things out of proportion and also not considering the Archbishop‚Äôs positions in the context of the time.‚ÄúWhat stood out most was the silence‚Äù buddy give the drama a rest. This is pretty dead subreddit, not much goes on here. Sorry nobody cares enough about the exact same things you do enough to comment on it, that has no bearing on the discussion.Archbishop Lefebrve was right to be skeptical of all Novus Ordo ordinations at the time because the Novus Ordo at the time was truly a lawless wasteland. For better or worse the Novus Ordo has reeled things in a bit; and as long as a sacrament has been validly conferred then there‚Äôs no reason to re-administer it, even conditionally.Honestly though, it seems like you‚Äôre either shilling for this YouTube Channel, or some other sedevacantist entity, not genuinely seeking the truth.The SSPX leadership is definitely flawed and has lots of issues, but broadly speaking they are still steering the ship in the same direction as the Archbishop."
1mfevl4,What Is a Layman Supposed to Do When No One Will Answer?,n6mrru9,Sad-Boysenberry-9578,2,"I appreciate the response. I am not trying to be dramatic. I am just asking the same question Archbishop Lefebvre asked. If there is doubt about a sacrament, why not remove the doubt?He conditionally ordained priests from the Novus Ordo because the form, matter, and intention were not always clear. That was not based on emotions or optics. It was based on the principle that doubtful sacraments must be treated as invalid until the doubt is resolved. That principle has not changed.The Novus Ordo may look more organized today, but the rite itself is the same. The intentions behind it, the theological mindset that shaped it, and the crisis that Archbishop Lefebvre saw still exist. That is why I am asking. Not to stir controversy, but to hold the same line he held.I am not a sedevacantist. I am promoting the original Society Archbishop Lefebvre founded the one that stood for doctrinal clarity, conditional ordinations, and the full rejection of modernism. If the Archbishop insisted on conditional ordination to protect the faithful, why would we stop doing that now?"
1mfevl4,What Is a Layman Supposed to Do When No One Will Answer?,n6phqdx,Piklikl,0,"‚ÄúI am promoting the original Society Archbishop Lefebvre founded‚Äù is resistance/sedevacantist phrasing, which is disingenuous at best and flat out Protestant at is worst. I have no idea if you‚Äôre affiliated with either of those movements, so I‚Äôll just assume you‚Äôre ignorant and attempt to rectify that.Every priest who was ordained in the NO is investigated to ascertain if the proper matter, form, and intention for the Sacrament of Holy Orders was conferred. If the investigating priests find no cause to doubt the validity of the sacrament, then there‚Äôs no reason to conditionally reordain. This is how it has always been done, including while the Archbishop was alive.Immediately following the liturgical ‚Äúreforms‚Äù brought about by Vatican II, things got quite crazy and there were plenty of cases of abuse and invalid sacraments being administered. This is why there were so many conditional ordinations back in the day, because they were necessary. The conciliar Church has reigned things in a bit (not so many invalid sacraments), and while the sacraments are being dispensed under the new rite, they are nevertheless valid.Archbishop Lefebvre never thought the new rite was invalid, only that it is worse than the Tridentine Rite."
1mfevl4,What Is a Layman Supposed to Do When No One Will Answer?,n6ptfa2,Sad-Boysenberry-9578,1,"You mentioned that conditional reordinations were only done ‚Äúback in the day.‚Äù But Archbishop Lefebvre said in 1988:‚ÄúAll sacraments from the modernist bishops or priests are doubtful now. The changes are increasing and their intentions are no more Catholic.‚Äù(Letter to Mr. Wilson, Oct 28, 1988)He also stated plainly:‚ÄúI have done this reordination many times.‚ÄùAnd in 1983:‚ÄúWe must perform an examination‚Ä¶ before we can say they are valid or invalid. We must study each case.‚Äù(Ridgefield conference, April 1983)This was not some isolated pastoral judgment. It was the public and theological policy of the SSPX itself, reflected in seminary formation and confirmed by the Society‚Äôs own 2001 Doctrinal Declaration, which warned of ‚Äúdoubts regarding the validity and liceity of the new rites.‚Äù That position remained until the shift after 2012.So it is neither Resistance nor sedevacantist to repeat Archbishop Lefebvre‚Äôs words. It is fidelity to him, to Catholic theology, and to the priesthood without doubt."

I‚Äôm certain conditional ordinations still happen at SSPX seminaries, but it makes sense that that they don‚Äôt happen as often because the conciliar Church has toned down the liturgical abuse."

We have to start looking at things a bit more critically.To even speak critically of a Jewish person will result in you being accused of anti-Semitic, even if you aren't.But yes, he made an ill judged remark on the holocaust and then started associating with a number of holocaust deniers and ultra-far right types.Just for reference, extreme right wing politics is just as abhorrent as extreme left wing politics.But the Jewish people, historically and today, are an exclusive ethnoreligious group that, unlike the Catholic church, is not open to all, does not care for logic and protects its followers to the exclusion of the gentiles.

1md8619,Bridal Veil Rules,n60kls2,Piklikl,7,"It is customary in most (if not all) SSPX locations in the US for women to veil during Mass, and this would include the bride. This is based on the traditions of Catholics in times past, though is not mandatory thing in a woman‚Äôs day to day life (and most female attendees of SSPX locations in Europe don‚Äôt follow it either).The SSPX does not want to encourage worldly fashion and has a conservative dress code when it comes to wedding attire. The SSPX worldwide does encourage women to veil as it is a traditional practice that emphasizes the sacredness of women, and St Paul does mention that women should be veiled in the Bible as well.Famously the SSPX does not consistently apply this dress code (for example it‚Äôs common for the priest to leave the approval of the wedding party dress to an older, out of touch woman with little to no sense of fashion or style; also different families get different treatment depending on how much said lady likes you or how much your dad has donated), so prepare yourself for a lot of frustration."

He said that it is an ambition of the SSPX to go back to some form of the 1954 Missal but their main objective is to try to get Rome to see sense about tradition and they (Rome) would never accept a jump to the 54 Missal. The response of Rome would simply be ""John XXIII issued this Missal, so it's the only one that you can use."" And there is, as you said, nothing that compromises the faith in the 62 Missal. I personally use a 1960 Missal which is nearly the same except the feasts are ranked slightly differently and there's no St Joseph in the canon.He went on to say, it's one thing at a time. And to be fair, the Pacellian reforms weren't all bad. The permission to offer mass in the evenings was a wonderful addition and Pius X almost certainly would have accepted this. As was the relaxing of the Eucharistic fast. The ranking of feasts also needed reform - as it has been observed - by the early 20th century, green vestments were almost never seen. This was not good as the real core of the faith is in the Sunday masses. So I think in time, the society will probably go back to the 1954 Missal but definitely not in the near future. There are some communities that are now using the pre-55 Missal - some that are regular (FSSP/ICKSP and some Oratorians) and some that are irregular (the Benedictines at Brignoles - where my friend from university is a priest)."

1mcv3rf,How do I respond to this,n6mk6l2,None,1,"Rando SSPXer who just wants to help get to the root of the point here. Food analogies only go so far. I think the major question is always twofold:1. Have the Popes since VII taught errors that are harmful to the Faith which is also in contradiction to previous correct teaching, and2. Are we currently in, and can we ever juridically be, in a position to assert this as a matter of fact even if our intuition tells us it is true.Preferring the old rite doesn't really make a difference. One could even personally prefer the new rite and still admit as a matter of fact that, that despite its validity, the NO is still lacking the fundamental aspects of a licit Mass and therefore it is dangerous.Me, I see 1 as a matter of fact which can be demonstrated both logically and historically, with evidence and using reason. However it was critical that Abp. Lefebvre had the position he had, and that we continue to have Bishops, if a good case for 2 being affirmative is still to be made. We aren't just deciding ourselves to be disobedient, we are concurring with those who were/are authoritatively in teaching positions inside the Church, who disagree with others in the same visible institution. The question is not settled, which is why it is an irregular but not severed connection to the larger Church.What constitutes a Catholic is the same for both - generally, adherence to the doctrines and dogmas promulgated authoritatively by the visible Church founded by Jesus Christ - but the difference lies in what those doctrines and dogmas are, and whether they were authoritatively promulgated. Modernism cannot ever be promulgated by anyone in any circumstance since it is an error.The difference between a reluctant NO attendee trad and a patron of the SSPX is usually in how they would answer 2."
1mcv3rf,How do I respond to this,n6mm1yn,Die_ElSENFAUST,1,I'm sure Arius and Nestorius looked at themselves as you did.Why would God just decide to allow his Vicar to fall into error after almost 2 millennia?
1mcv3rf,How do I respond to this,n6mvr7w,None,2,"That's a fair point. But so too did Athanasius. The rightness or wrongness of a Bishop in dissent is not decided by rank necessarily, in cases where truth can be demonstrated. I think everyone agrees that nobody can authoritatively teach an error - only accidentally promulgate a mistake - but determining the rightness or wrongness of a teaching is something that usually takes a few generations to bear out. That bearing out is happening right now.To answer your second question, the SSPX position as I understand it (and I agree with it) is that teaching a heresy by itself is not necessarily ""falling into error"" in the formal or irredeemable sense. Casual and non-infallible allusions by several Popes made to a purely pastoral council that was highly political in hindsight are regrettable, confusing, and dangerous, but it isn't like the determination that there were demonstrable errors at VII disproves the papacy. If anathemas were issued or infallibility invoked, etc, then it would be different."
1mcv3rf,How do I respond to this,n6sd9td,Die_ElSENFAUST,1,"So Because Vat II did not declare things in the way that say Nicea I did, it does not disprove the papacy?"
1mcv3rf,How do I respond to this,n722kt7,None,1,"Correct. Nicaea convened by all accounts to settle fundamental matters of Faith, and then it did so. The products of the council are foundational to the Catholic Faith. Vatican II, in contrast, was convened explicitly as a pastoral council, in order to find a way to repackage the Faith in a way more conducive to ""Modern man"" (whatever that is), but not to fundamentally change anything in matters of Faith or morals. Both John XXIII and Paul VI said that exact same thing - it is merely a question of the Church's strategy in modernity, not in its substance. Now the SSPX maintains while this may have been the original intention, that ultimately there were demonstrable ideological changes that have had an obvious effect on the life and mind of the Church as an institution. These changes were due to the Council being hijacked by an extremely prepared and well-coordinated ideological contingency devoted, sadly, to the Modernism that Pius X warned about explicitly throughout his entire Papacy. But, because the council was unambiguously non-dogmatic, questioning its implementation and promulgation is not questioning Papal authority, nor is it questioning the Faith. We can acknowledge that Pope Paul VI earnestly desired to reform the Church for his day, that as Pope he certainly ordered people to implement the reform, that the reform is imperfect and it itself needs clarification on all doctrinal points which were ambiguous on purpose (with some clarification essentially refuting certain statements on the most egregiously weaponized ambiguities), and we can still submit to the Pope. The Pope is allowed to be wrong when there is no expectation of infallibility, even when he, and a majority of the Church under him, insists that he is right. This is the position of the SSPX. I adopted it because it seems reasonable to me. I think we can eat our cake and have it too on this one. When you love someone then you correct them fraternally, and we ought to love each and every one of our Holy Fathers, and desire sincerely that Christ's will be done as effectively as possible in the visible institution of the Church. A reform that does a service for one moment in time may be doing it a disservice in the next moment.As an American, I look at it like our border laws. The laws never changed between administrations, but we had one administration that upheld them, and another one that claimed it upheld them, but from a visible standpoint it was clear that the change in strategy resulted in the laws not achieving their stated goals. Regardless of how one feels about the laws, the laws themselves did not change substantively; only the political will to implement them in a certain way changed. I would like to believe that it was ignorance and not malice that resulted in the change in tactics by those with the authority to uphold the law. But either way, the laws don't need to change to fix the problem, we just need strong leaders to do what we already said we were going to do on paper. So too with the crisis in the Church, and with Her laws. The Faith itself is the remedy to problems that stem primarily from strategic ambiguity."

1mcv3rf,How do I respond to this,n7m1s9o,None,1,"I highly recommend it. I recommend reading what the SSPX has to say about it in their own materials, if you want to know their true position, since their position is usually strawmanned by very uninformed but perhaps well-meaning people. It is not as harsh as many are led to believe, and many of their questions are both theologically tenable as well as unsettled juridically.It's not an easy question, and as Catholics, we shouldn't take even the possibility of anything that could even potentially be misconstrued as disobedience lightly. It was something I had to look at very carefully myself. It is a fact that the SSPX is superficially disobedient in certain matters. The questions that need answered are, what is real obedience, what are the limits of authority, and in what way is authority rightly exercised; and these questions need to be answered in the context of the indefectible teaching of the one, holy, Catholic, and apostolic Church.I don't believe in following any organization blindly, so here's another resource I found helpful which makes the case from the other side:https://www.wordonfire.org/vatican-ii-faq/#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cpastoral%E2%80%9D%20council?-,No.,merely%20dealing%20with%20pastoral%20matters.This is a refutation of the SSPX claims done by Word on Fire (Bishop Barron's publication). WoF is usually really good, and I listen to Bp. Barron speak regularly. If anyone can make an honest effort to oppose the SSPX, I believe it would be them. But the logic holes in this argument further convinced me that the SSPX could be on to something. For example, I don't consider a ban on the Mass said by the Church for thousands of years, the placement of radically ideological appointments who produced unprecedented and unjust outcomes (I am cancelling your Masses for your own good, I promise!) and the ensuing chaos in the Faith (expressed in apostasy rates, poor catechesis, and an explosion of liturgical nonsense) as legitimate acts of an""obviously authentic"" (but not infallible) magisterium. The SSPX just says these things actually look very much like mistakes when judged in the light of Tradition, and that owning up to them and undoing them, rather than doubling down on them, is the only way to restore the broader Institution. I also don't understand the claim that pastoral material not declared infallible is still ""under the protection of the Holy Spirit."" The Holy Spirit does not will, nor protect, error. It sounds like they are ginning up technical infallibility where it is juridically inappropriate to do so. SSPX gets criticized for Ultramontanism (hyper-Papalism) because of their reliance on encyclicals from anti-Modernist Popes. But Modernists do the same thing with their preferred Popes and writings. This is essentially why this matter is juridically unsettled, since there are opposing claims produced by the same visible institution which are unresolved.It is a bit like what CS Lewis said in Mere Christianity: if it can be demonstrated that we are headed in the wrong direction, the most progressive person is the one who starts going backward first. And we avoid false antiquarianism because we are only returning to the precise moment before the trouble effectively starts - a Missal approved and promulgated by the very same Pope that convened VII - and we lose no dogma or doctrine in the process, aside from fallible materials produced in VII that Modernists and Boomers have been pretending is infallible for decades now.Anyways, SSPX still accepts 95% of VII, mostly because, by design (see Bugnini), the council was designed to be ambiguous. So material lacking in substance is easy to accept because it doesn't really say anything. It is only certain statements regarding religious liberty, ecumenism, and collegiality that they take issue with. These statements, far from a ""reinterpretation"" of doctrine, directly and demonstrably contradict previous teachings of the indefectible magisterium of times past. These issues, when researched, become clearly connected with the structural issues of today's visible institution of the Church, which began resulting at the very same time - not as a coincidence, but as a direct effect of these novel teachings, the SSPX argues.God bless you as you ask the tough questions! Even if you ultimately disagree, please remember that the SSPX loves the Church, we love Novis Ordo goers, and in large part we hope sincerely for a proper reunion for the sake of the world's souls. We are just working out our salvation with fear and trembling in the meantime at the Mass of the Ages.EDIT: Let me know if you have any questions as I would be happy to answer them"

""Orthodox"" clergy however, being schismatics, are not subject to the canon law of the Catholic Church, and so may indeed be able to validly hear confessions and absolve sins so long as they are validly ordained.Edit: This of course shows once again that the SSPX are in communion with (are part of) the Catholic Church.

No conozco a absolutamente ning√∫n cat√≥lico en mi c√≠rculo social, al menos un cat√≥lico de verdad.

Therefore even if he was a blasphemer he could have repented before death and he could be in heaven now, and therefore de facto a saint, so I don't see a contradiction. It is my belief that something mysterious happens when someone is in deathbed, if that weren't the case virtually everyone would go to hell without a doubt, even believers.But none of that equals to him being good, the videos prove he was a blasphemer and condoned religious indifferentism, how can he be an example of faith and the voice of God for you?Do you think Saint Peter would have kissed a book blaspheming against Jesus, his mother and his teachings etc like John Paul II did? Do you think Saint Peter would have said all religions save and would have blessed the icon of a demon inside the most holy church?"
1ltwu33,Torn apart inside...,n2ugned,rebornrovnost,1,"My brother, I believe you should study further what consists a blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. Regarding the links, I believe they show a subjective (and quite partial) analysis of SJPII‚Äôs actions. [In no moment did he affirm that all religions save](https://www.catholic.com/video/is-pope-francis-a-heretic), for instance. His theology (deeply misunderstood) is one that requires careful study. About kissing the Quran, I definitely don‚Äôt think that Saint Peter would have done it, considering it didn‚Äôt exist at the time. But Saint John Paul II, polish, having lived through World War II and witnessing the catastrophe of interreligious disputes, perhaps he felt the personal responsibility to, as Head of the Church of Christ, express his complete disregard for the same hatred that burned the world, all those years ago. Perhaps kissing the Quran was not the right move, but the Pope acted with the intention of peace, and this should suffice on what we ask of a human being. If there is any judgement to be made on this, we would be wise on leaving it to God, who knows all things.Again, no matter your personal intuitions, do stop saying that he has committed the unforgivable sin (which is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit)."
1ltwu33,Torn apart inside...,n2v3yi8,londonderry99,1,"My second question was a reference to Francis, actually. As I said, John Paul II did offend the Holy Spirit directly with what he said as the video shows, so he did commit blasphemy against him. It may not be what you're referring to, but that's not what I meant. John Paul II was very close to this, but only Francis directly said all religions save. And I don't see how the great wars were based on religion. Nazis were secular, Soviets atheists. The first world war also had nothing to do with religion since the catalyst was a terrorist seeking to have his home region annexed by the country of his ethnic group, if anything, both were based on nationalism and race but not religion directly by any means. Catholic French and Catholic English people killed each other for hundreds of years, Sunni Muslims and pagans too between themselves, and the list goes on. To further explain, as I previously said, the holy spirit is also a personal being so if you for instance curse him you are committing a blasphemy against the holy spirit, I did not mean that in the sense of ""blasphemy against the spirit of truth by refusing to accept the truth or denying the Catholic religion or miracles or the mercy of God or spirituality"". The video proves he offended him directly with what he said."

A See that has always inviolably preserved the dogma of the faith.2nd It is argued that the Roman Rite must always be preserved in its integrity, without substantial modifications as occurred in 1969. In other words, a radical reform of a centuries-old rite of the Catholic Church is illegitimate.

It's worth remembering that prior to this, the Roman Rite was not at all uniform across the west. There were lots of regional variations. Where I am from, we had the use of Sarum, the use of York, the use of Durham and the various monastic and religious rites - but there was a lot of commonality - and the Anaphora (the canon - or ""Eucharistic Prayer"" to use a modern term...) was consistent to all of them.The Eastern churches that reconciled with Rome were encouraged to gently conform their liturgy with the Latin forms. But they had a lot of practices that were alien to the Roman Rite, not least, the use of Coptic, Slavonic, Syriac and Greek instead of Latin.In the wake of the 2nd Vatican Council, the Eastern Catholic churches were encouraged to change their liturgy too, in the spirit of the Romans. They encouraged more lay participation - prior to this, the Eastern rite was clearly divided into the laity and the clergy, and the use of vernacular language was encouraged away from the use of either Latin or the various liturgical languages of the East.The church is not divided into East and West - they can be considered two sides of the same body. Lungs if you will, from which the breath of the faith (the *spiritus* or *œÄŒΩŒµœçŒºŒ±*) comes forth.There were many Eastern Catholics who were unhappy - they formed the Society of St Josephat Kuntsevych who are affiliated with the SSPX.So in short, yes, short hand is the Mass of All Time to refer to the Tridentine Mass, simply because, it's the most commonly celebrated rite within the traditionalist movement. But there are other traditional liturgies available.As a slight aside, I will add that the Eastern Orthodox are not immune to these types of splits. The Old Believers emerged in the Russian Orthodox church in the 17th century, in response to the reforms made by the then Patriarch of Moscow, Nikon. The old believers persist in their practice to this day, despite being anathemised."

1ldx7ul,What version of the Roman Missal does the SSPX use for its Latin Masses?,mybpdtc,dbaughmen,6,"This is a long controversy in the SSPX, they use the 1962 missal to favour the Vatican. As Abp Lefebvre said to the American priests that the Vatican would never reconcile with them or accept them with the pre-55, as at the time the only ones using the pre-55 were the Americans. On very very few occasions they use pre-55 holy week, but in secret. There are many problems with the 62, and the SSPX knows and accepts this, but has never done anything about it."
1ldx7ul,What version of the Roman Missal does the SSPX use for its Latin Masses?,myeq32a,No-Test6158,2,"This is what spurred the nine to leave the SSPX after a meeting at Oyster Bay Cove, NY in 1983. They were not happy with Abp Lefebvre's acceptance of the 62 Missal or his tolerance of the second Vatican council. For reference, the position of the SSPX is that the second Vatican council is valid and binding in about 90% of its texts - it's just that the 10% is particularly egregious in how it affects the faith (recommend reading *They Have Uncrowned Him - Abp Lefebvre* for full details).The 55 revisions were the first dip in the water for the ultimate revisions of the Mass. Many Catholics at the time were completely unaware and it really empowered Fr Bugnini to be able to push on with his more radical reforms. But the fruits of the rebellious nine became clear, as they were soon suckered into open Sedevacantism and left the Society.I cannot deny their faith and for me, I prefer the pre-55 ceremonials. The hand Missal I use was published in 1960 which is a bit of a weird middle ground between 55 and 62. It has both the pre-55 and post-55 Holy Week and the name of St Joseph is not included in the canon. But, we are called to be obedient to Rome to a point. We cannot accept heresy but as the 62 Missal is generally in conformity with Roman Catholic tradition, it remains acceptable to use.So, if I could find a group that was both obedient to the Holy See and also followed the 54 Missal, I'd jump on it, but the SSPX holds a very great position in terms of Roman Catholic tradition.And to add to this, I recently spoke with a fairly senior priest within the society who said that the 54 Missal remained on the table, but was a goal of the Society once they had managed to get the main church to return to more normal Traditions. But we still have a long way to go. Bishop Fellay said it, in a sermon some years ago, that the traditional movement is like a seedling in the early spring. If it grows too fast and too quickly without putting down solid roots, then a frost will come and kill it, so great care must be taken in how we proceed. But Our Lord will triumph in the end!"

They immediately precede the quote above from the same letter: ""Another mistake, which I deeply regret, is the fact that the extent and limits of the provision of 21 January 2009 were not clearly and adequately explained at the moment of its publication. The excommunication affects individuals, not institutions. An episcopal ordination lacking a pontifical mandate raises the danger of a schism, since it jeopardizes the unity of the College of Bishops with the Pope. Consequently the Church must react by employing her most severe punishment ‚Äì excommunication ‚Äì with the aim of calling those thus punished to repent and to return to unity. Twenty years after the ordinations, this goal has sadly not yet been attained. The remission of the excommunication has the same aim as that of the punishment: namely, to invite the four Bishops once more to return. This gesture was possible once the interested parties had expressed their recognition in principle of the Pope and his authority as Pastor, albeit with some reservations in the area of obedience to his doctrinal authority and to the authority of the Council. Here I return to the distinction between individuals and institutions. The remission of the excommunication was a measure taken in the field of ecclesiastical discipline: the individuals were freed from the burden of conscience constituted by the most serious of ecclesiastical penalties. This disciplinary level needs to be distinguished from the doctrinal level. The fact that the Society of Saint Pius X does not possess a canonical status in the Church is not, in the end, based on disciplinary but on doctrinal reasons. As long as the Society does not have a canonical status in the Church, its ministers do not exercise legitimate ministries in the Church. There needs to be a distinction, then, between the disciplinary level, which deals with individuals as such, and the doctrinal level, at which ministry and institution are involved. In order to make this clear once again: until the doctrinal questions are clarified, the Society has no canonical status in the Church, and its ministers ‚Äì even though they have been freed of the ecclesiastical penalty ‚Äì do not legitimately exercise any ministry in the Church.""He makes it clear that the lifting of excommunication was a move of mercy, not an indication that the Vatican was wrong.

In the examples above, if you went to your friend's house for a meal, fully knowing they were going to serve you meat, just so you could, then it would be sinful.As others have said, the society kinda keeps a position somewhere between the 1917 and 1983 CCL, so it's hard to pin down an exact position here. But, for ease of argument, let's assume that the society's position is aligned with Rome. Consult the CCL 1983 with respect to this - Canons 1244-1253.Ultimately, it is down to the local ordinary to decide what days are penitential.

They have doubled down on this quote for 60 years, at some point you have to say ""this is their philosophy, this is not just a quote"".> This is the operational definition of being in schism.First, please read [ST III](https://isidore.co/aquinas/summa/TP/TP082.html#TPQ82A9THEP1): ""Whether one should take communion from heretical priests?"" (short answer: no). We are not in communion with people who formally declare the heresy that everything on earth should serve man - even if they're not yet excommunicated, as they should be for their apostasy. We are Catholics, they are - at least formally - heretics.We are in schism from the Conciliar Church, not the Catholic Church. To ""schism"" means to cut yourself off (from tradition). Now, who cut himself off ""the Church"", they or us? Who invented a ""New Mass"", several ""New Rites"", a ""New understanding of Tradition"" - they or us? They were the ones who invented new, schismatic doctrine, a new, schismatic Mass, a new schismatic everything. We keep to the same, eternal faith. I think it's pretty evident who did the schism.Their error is to equate mans glory with Gods glory. Mans soul (not body) was created in the image of God, but it was created to worship and extend Gods glory, not to be worshipped himself. Man is most definitely not the center of everything on earth. Second, man is tainted by original sin, so he needs Christ as the redeemer to be able .> There is no doubt there is a new mass, but a new church? If you believe that, go ahead.Yes, they are a new ""church"":- A new philosophy centered on serving man- A new Hegelian understanding of Tradition (tradition now has to be constantly moving and changing and rock-n-rolling, otherwise it's a ""dead, static tradition"")- A new faith built on ""religious experiences"" (i.e. ""faith"" is now an experience, which explains their idiotic New Mass, to give people a good experience), which explains why there is now salvation in any religion- An ecumenist pope who prays together with Muslims- A new understanding of the priest being merely a ""presider over a meal"", not the Catholic understanding- An ecclesiology built on a co-governing Synodal Church, instead of the Catholic hierarchy of ""pope - bishops - priests - laity""- A new, schismatic Mass riteIt is a ""Newchurch"", a ship of Theseus: At what point does it stop being the ""Catholic Church"" if everything that is Catholic is changed into something new, step by step? Is it then wrong to say ""this is not the *Catholic* Church anymore - we don't know what it is, but compared with 100 years ago, this is something else""?The term ""Newchurch"" was coined by Lefebvre, I believe (not sure). It's to express that whatever these people believe they're doing, it's at its core built on a new philosophy that puts Man as the center and crown, not God. There are remnants of the Catholic Faith in the Newchurch, but it's definitely not 100% Catholic anymore, in practice. They have the buildings, we have the faith and the faith is more important for getting to heaven.> I'm not a theologian and will not pretend to be one.My comment was a very, very condensed version of [Prometheus: The Religion of Man by Fr.

The procedure has changed over time but the current procedure is the conclave.Modern times aren't the first instance of having bad popes. Pope Benedict IX who was pope during the 11^(th) century is the only pope to have ever sold the papacy. He was initially elected due to bribery and his papacy was so scandalous that it led to a revolt by the Roman population. Pope Victor III in his third book of the *Dialogues* talks about>\[Pope Benedict IX's\] rapes, murders and other unspeakable acts of violence and sodomy. His life as a pope was so vile, so foul, so execrable, that I shudder to think of itHe committed multiple murders and had multiple adulterous affairs, all while pope. Saint Peter Damian, Doctor of the Church, wrote in his *Liber Gomorrhianus* about Benedict IX's engagement in acts of sodomy, bestiality and his frequent sponsoring of orgies.This is not the only instance of horrific medieval popes. Pope John XII died while in the middle of the sexual act with a married woman. The woman's husband returned home and, while John XII was defiling his wife, he took a rock and caved his skull in with it.The Church regards both Benedict IX and John XII as valid popes and if you deny that either were valid popes then you are a schismatic and a heretic.Keep these facts in mind when you ponder whether the validity of someone's papacy is determinate on such criteria."

1kzhv29,How strict is the ‚ÄúSunday Best‚Äù requirement?,mv5kagf,Duibhlinn,5,"In my experience the commonly understood application of that term among traditionalists is that it's the best that a person can reasonably manage. There are some people who act uncharitably about the attire of others but it's thankfully an extreme minority. There are arseholes in every sphere of life, the traditional movement isn't immune from that problem. Generally people starting arguments with others because they don't approve of their attire is not looked kindly upon. It's petty, effeminate behaviour that's unbecoming of a Catholic to engage in.Now that said, everything I'm saying is within reason, but the cases that aren't within reason are extremely rare. You generally aren't going to be seeing people show up to Mass looking like they walked straight out of a nudist colony.The standards in the diocesan Latin Masses are generally not as high so it's unfortunately not as uncommon as it should be to see women at the diocesan TLMs attired in a not so modest fashion, even by secular standards. I'm sure it does happen occasionally but it's definitely far rarer at SSPX Masses.It's also heavily dependent on what country you're in and what the culture there is. A man attending the Latin Mass in Ireland who is attired as a traditional or old fashioned Irishman would be is going to look quite different to an American, a Russian, a Korean etc. Seeing Hanfu at a Latin Mass in China is not unusual, but if you saw it in Europe it would probably be a bit strange.Once you have a degree of common sense you should be fine."

Whilst there are some people who are actually too poor to purchase nicer clothes and it would be a corporal work of mercy to buy then nicer clothes, I would say many times a lot of people use arguments along this line of thought, or of being ‚Äúuncharitable‚Äù to other, or invoking some false humility masked with a naturalistic humanitarian view saying ‚Äúoh so and so saint or Our Lord didn‚Äôt dress like that‚Äù.

It is common for SSPX priests to have to remind the faithful not to do this.     Instead, you should consider the indirect approach and attempt to form some sort of genuine relationship and attempt to influence them for the better. Also it probably wouldn't be very charitable to offer to buy someone you think is poor nice clothes, you'll either humiliate the genuinely poor person or end up humiliated yourself (a lady once tried to offer an oncologist who was attending Mass on vacation money because she thought he was homeless). I don't think any of this is grave matter (if someone is going to actually apostosize because of negative comments from some rando about their outfit, that's more their problem), but it is certainly very rude to be so forward to a total stranger."

Sspx definitely advocates for and prefers men in suits but they will never kick you out unless you're wearing some egregiously inappropriate outfit, which I have never seen happen. I sometimes see boomers in short sleeve Hawaiian shirts and khaki pants.

The thing is, most people are financially and personally capable of wearing a suit and otherwise nice clothes to a job interview. How much more important is God compared to a prospective employer?

1kzg7po,Opinion on Ecclesia Dei communities?,mv5b8rn,ViveChristusRex,14,"I know this is the opposite of what you asked, but I mainly attend ICKSP (I have an SSPX chapel nearby though).

One stated that Archbishop Lefebvre should be canonized, but that it would unfortunately likely not happen in our lifetime due to the politicization of the topic.From what I have heard, the ICKSP is much more preferable to the FSSP, and are‚Äîon average‚Äîmore sympathetic to the SSPX (which makes sense, considering how the FSSP was formed).

I'd say the ICKSP is probably the least bad as they are more honest about the fact that they don't really think much about the liturgy and doctrines and all that stuff, they're just in it for the smells and bells.

1kzg7po,Opinion on Ecclesia Dei communities?,mv5vl1i,PleasantStorm4241,9,"As an SSPX attendee, I appreciate your sharing that. I wonder whether the charitable sentiments are common among the ICKSP. The closest ICKSP is several hours away, and I have hoped to visit it when I travel to visit a friend who lives close to it.The priests at the FSSP parish neighboring my SSPX chapel are anti-SSPX. Certainly, they are not the only ones out there. As one of my priory priests has said, the opinion of FSSP priests about the SSPX varies from priest to priest. Short answer to the OP:I am willing to attend Masses of the Ecclesia Dei communities, but I still believe the SSPX remains the community who is the best at preaching overall and standing against modernism.Long answer:I used to attend the FSSP parish mentioned above for Mass or confession occasionally when my chapel (Mass on Sundays only) did not offer either, but I cannot bring myself to go anymore. As someone once said, ""Archbishop Lefebvre founded two orders,"" and, at the least, the FSSP priests should show some charity towards their roots, some gratitude towards Archbishop Lefebvre, even though they disagree with what happened and the SSPX's not only surviving but also prospering.Speaking for myself, I will attend an FSSP church (other than the one above) or an ICKSP church if an SSPX chapel is not available. However, I do know hardcore SSPX attendees who will go ONLY to SSPX chapels. I disagree with that as they are making, in my opinion, the SSPX its own church and its priests as infallible; the SSPX has been disappointing in some areas in recent years and I will leave my thoughts at that. If you share with fellow SSPX attendees that you attend Masses other than those of the SSPX, reactions will range from shock, with perhaps some disgust, to, ""we go elsewhere, too, sometimes."" I am careful with whom I share such information.However, in support of the SSPX-only crowd, I found sermons at the above-mentioned FSSP parish, when I attended, to be soft. Not in error, necessarily, but bland, as though the priests were afraid to speak out on the difficult issues most in the current public forum. The most recent bishop of that diocese was sadly quite progressive and dismantled two TLM communities as soon as Traditiones Custodes came out, so I suspect that could be the reason why their sermons were not as strong as SSPX sermons."

Fr Bisig was rector of the SSPX seminary in Zaitzkofen and participated in these ‚Äúillicit‚Äù ordinations on a yearly basis.

There were many guys (myself included) who only knew FSSP and did not have an SSPX presence nearby our homes.

I live far from the SSPX and any TLM (and even Eastern Catholic) and always drive solo. I have no one with whom to share a ride, and have often struggled to stay awake on my drives. There have been close calls. It would be absolutely crazy out of the way for anyone at my chapel to pick me up and drive me. I go when I am up to it, and when I cannot, I go to an NO that is one of the better ones. I focus on the readings, I pray the Confiteor and Pater Noster in Latin, I focus on the consecration (as abbreviated as it is), I veil, I dress modestly. (I try to sit away from people to avoid the handshake...ugh.) While the NO I attend has the problems intrinsic to the NO, liturgy and external, it is at least average, maybe a little better than average. The priest has the congregation pray for the pope, pray for vocations and pray the St Michael prayer. Plus I was stunned when it had the blessing of candles for Candlemas a couple years ago.

You should also go to confession and confess the sin of schism.In the absence of more official options due to the crisis in the Church, I think this would suffice.I would also e-mail the priest at the closest SSPX church and ask them what to do, just to confirm.

1kvgo8c,Abp. Lefebvre‚Äôs comments about ‚ÄúThe Nine‚Äù,muuqf3p,mattdamon992,0,"The response from Ferrari_Fan_16, critiquing the Novus Ordo Mass and referencing the SSPX, requires a thorough rebuttal rooted in the Magisterium and proper Catholic doctrine, always in union with Rome.The Novus Ordo, promulgated by Pope Paul VI in 1969 following Vatican II, is a legitimate expression of the Roman Rite, approved by the Church‚Äôs supreme authority. Vatican II‚Äôs *Sacrosanctum Concilium* (paragraph 4) reaffirms the Church‚Äôs right to adapt liturgical forms while preserving their substance, ensuring continuity with tradition. The claim that it lacks fidelity to Church teaching is unfounded, as upheld by popes like St. John Paul II and Benedict XVI, who emphasized its validity and encouraged reverent celebration.Specific criticisms such as the lack of enforced confession before receiving the Eucharist or diminished emphasis on the Social Kingship of Christ - reflect misunderstandings or misapplications, not liturgical defects. The Church teaches the necessity of grace for Communion (Catechism, 1385), with enforcement left to pastoral discretion. The Social Kingship of Christ, detailed by Pius XI in *Quas Primas* (1925), is rearticulated in modern teaching, as in *Gaudium et Spes* (paragraph 43), to address contemporary contexts.The SSPX, however, has placed itself outside full communion due to its unauthorized 1988 consecrations, deemed schismatic by Pope John Paul II in *Ecclesia Dei*. Its rejection of Vatican II and the Novus Ordo contradicts the Church‚Äôs living tradition. Benedict XVI‚Äôs 2009 letter with *Summorum Pontificum* clarified that both the Tridentine Mass and Novus Ordo are valid forms of the same Rite, countering the SSPX‚Äôs narrative of rupture.The accusation that the Novus Ordo and modern man are disobedient mischaracterizes the issue. Disobedience lies in rejecting papal authority and the Council, as the SSPX has done, not in the liturgy offered by Rome. True fidelity means embracing the Church‚Äôs full tradition, including its living Magisterium, under the successor of Peter, guided by the Holy Spirit."

Of course, they will ask where the hierarchy of the Church is, and I, unlike most Sedes, will say that there must be at least one Catholic diocesan bishop left taking office through common error, though I cannot name him. This is at least an answer to show that my position is at least possible, but the mainstream SSPX cannot pretend that they do not suffer from the same problem: a hierarchy which teaches heresy is just as problematic as no hierarchy at all, and the hierarchy the mainstream SSPX suggests has taught a huge number of heresies, frankly in a way that would fulfil the conditions of the ordinary and universal magisterium and thus be infallible. Invoking the Vincentian canon does not resolve this since the interpretation required is a novelty (See Cardinal Franzelin on this, thesis XXIV).In short, no other explanation resolves the problem of an infallible Church apparently contradicting Herself and teaching heresy, or being prima facie an unreliable guide to salvation, giving the faithful poison, other than a long-term vacancy of the Holy See. The objection of the visibility of the hierarchy posited cannot defeat it as a heretical hierarchy is just as much of a problem as no hierarchy, and this whole problem is not explained away by so-called ‚ÄòR&Rers‚Äô without twisting Catholic theology and creating novelties."

See the text from Franzelin on the Vincentian canon in my post history). See Vatican I‚Äôs Dei Filius. She is also infallible in judging the certainty of things which are not divinely revealed, but without certainty of which divine revelation itself would be imperiled (for example, philosophy of identity with regard to Christ‚Äòs nature). This includes what are termed the secondary objects of infallibility (canonisations, disciplines, the rules of religious orders, etc.), and relate more to the Church as a sure and reliable guide to salvation.Whilst it is conceivably possible that an error of an unimportant theological note could be taught non-definitively, it is completely against the accepted ecclesiology to suggest that the universal ordinary magisterium could teach heresy or pernicious error. The very basis of the UPA argument which anti-Sedes constantly use against us is that the Church cannot adhere to a false rule of Faith, since then the whole Church would be led into error, which is impossible. The same reasoning is used by the theologians to demonstrate that the consensus of the theologians or of the Fathers cannot be erroneous, since their teaching is so connected with the UOM that the whole Church would be led into error if they taught it with a consensus, but since it‚Äôs impossible for the UOM to teach error, this cannot happen.Frankly, I don‚Äôt see why the people who attack this standard theology are so keen to be part of a fallible Church.

1ktcv0b,Question about SSPX from former Methodist,mtt9e84,USAFrenchMexRadTrad,12,"You misunderstand.  Latin is used liturgically because it's a dead language and dead languages don't change definitions, making it more difficult to mess with doctrine and interpret it in a heterodox manner.  Not impossible, but far more difficult.Take a look at the people who claim the US Constitution is a ""living document"".  It was written in modern English, yes, but it's closer to the archaic modern English, and the context of writings of the same authors is needed.  The ""living document"" interpreters seek to toss out context and change the meaning of the text for various political ends.The vernacular of the other rites isn't an issue, as long as they stick to the Faith.  The problem with the Novus Ordo isn't that the SSPX clergy ""despise"" it for being in vernacular.  The TLM could be in vernacular instead of Latin and it wouldn't have most of the problems of Novus Ordo parishes.  The Novus Ordo's biggest problem is that it was written as an experiment to attract Protestants by removing anything in the prayers that would be ""overly"" Catholic and off-putting to them.  The Church has long held to the time tested idea of ""Lex Orandi, Lex Credendi"", the way of prayer is the way of belief.  It's why medieval peasants, though largely illiterate, knew their doctrine better than you'd expect.  The prayers reflect a greater fullness of the Faith.  The liturgy developed slowly and organically over a long period of time, not the result of some grand experiment based on bad assumptions.Since ""Lex Orandi, Lex Credendi"" seems to be true, most Catholics now act and believe more like Protestants do.  We have less Protestants converting than we did before the Novus Ordo was made available for use, and far more Catholics leaving the Faith.  Before, even if a Catholic did leave, they were less likely to become hostile toward the Faith, have misconceptions about it, or join a non-Catholic sect.  Married priests are also just an administrative issue, not an issue of doctrine or dogma.  We used to have married priests in the West, but got rid of them because too many ""careerist"" clergy were leaving Church property to their children and overall cronyism was rampant."

It also believes that Latin is the liturgical language for the Roman Rite, and the vernacular shouldn't be used. Basically, Lefebvre and therefore the SSPX oppose the Novus Ordo because it downplays the sacrificial nature of the mass in multiple ways and therefore protestantizes it. The SSPX is not opposed to the eastern rites of the Church, but is definitively Latin-rite. The novus Ordo of the Anglican-use ordinariate is still a Novus Ordo, and is opposed by the SSPX."

1kt30qq,Do you think Vatican II is not a real council?,mtqi7p3,No-Test6158,15,"Hmm, this is an interesting one. Vatican II was definitely a real council, but I agree, it was seized by certain influences (modernists, masons etc.) who made every effort to suppress the Catholic faith.It was necessary to call a council in the days after the 2 world wars and the massive social revolution. But the church should never have decided to conform with society.The position of the society is that about 90% of the council documents are acceptable, but the 10% that isn't is particularly egregious and needs further clarification to ensure that it cannot be interpreted in a terrible way.I would recommend that you should read ""They have uncrowned Him"" and ""I accuse the Council"" by Abp Lefebvre."
1kt30qq,Do you think Vatican II is not a real council?,mtrawno,Ferrari_Fan_16,7,"I like Father Hesse but he does seem to go off the deep end at times. The SSPX position is that Vatican 2 was a very real council. I also disagree with your opinion that there was no real crisis to justify calling it (as another comment states, WW2 happened, the sexual revolution happened, communism was raging etc.) Just because it is a real council does not mean it must be perfect. There are 2 modes of extraordinary magisterium (which is perfect): council, or ex cathedra papal teaching. Paul VI said very plainly and explicitly that Vatican 2 was completely a use of ordinary magisterium, which is not infallible/perfect but binding. However, when ordinary magisterium contradicts previous ordinary magisterium, it can‚Äôt possibly undo the original teaching on something.This is why the SSPX does not approve of the teachings on religious liberty, collegiality, and ecumenism. Other than those things Vatican 2 is acceptable according to Bishop Fellay. What‚Äôs even more concerning is the hierarchy today use Vatican 2 as some sort of wildcard that can mean literally anything. Taken in its original interpretation the hierarchy contradict Vatican 2 in many ways."

Hesse says the solution right in his talk ""Why Catholics may doubt VII was a valid council"":> But the point I‚Äôm making is, a council has by its very own nature extraordinary Magisterium, not ordinary Magisterium. This is universally agreed to by almost all theologians. Now, what happened at Vatican II, the council itself declares that it has ordinary Magisterium. This is what I call a beautiful example of legal suicide. If a council that by its very definition and nature has extraordinary Magisterium says about itself that it has ordinary Magisterium. >> Does it say that? You don‚Äôt believe me? Switch on this beeping pile of plastic of yours called computer, go onto this funny thing called website with the W-W-W-W-W such com dot et cetera, and look up the documents of Vatican II. You will find Lumen Gentium, the so-called dogmatic, means only its teaching, Dogmatic Constitution of the Church, Lumen Gentium. >> As an appendix to this, you will find a declaration by the secretary of the council, Archbishop Felici, who later on became cardinal and happened to be one of my best friends in Rome when I was there for 15 years. He died, unfortunately, in 1982. But he himself confirmed to me what I‚Äôm saying now, and he confirmed that to Archbishop Lefebvre too, that the council actually does not pretend infallibility. It does not pretend the extraordinary Magisterium because in this appendix to Lumen Gentium, it says:>> ‚ÄûWhatever has been said in this council enjoys the power of ordinary Magisterium, unless otherwise stated.‚Äü There is no unless otherwise stated in the entire collection of the conciliar documents. And therefore, how can you say this was a council if it doesn‚Äôt even correspond to the very essence of a council being of extraordinary Magisterium?And he's right:> ""Taking conciliar custom into consideration and also the **pastoral purpose** of the present Council, the sacred Council defines as binding on the Church **only those things in matters of faith and morals which it shall openly declare to be binding** (note: it didn't declare anything to be binding). The rest of the things which the sacred Council sets forth, inasmuch as they are the teaching of the Church's supreme magisterium, ought to be accepted and embraced by each and every one of Christ's faithful according to the mind of the sacred Council (note: the ""Spirit of Vatican II""). The mind of the Council becomes known either from the matter treated or from its manner of speaking, in accordance with the norms of theological interpretation.""> > -- Lumen Gentium, Appendix ISo, Vatican II itself says that Vatican II is not binding.

If you want to see the action of the Holy Spirit in this council, it is there, but it is not in how many of the modernists interpret it.Before V2, many priests said the Traditional Mass in a very irreverent way. Mumbling through with little interest. The priests who wanted to stick to it were the ones who did not and they were exactly who went on to lead the nascent traditionalist movement.Sure, some got sidetracked or went too far - but the traditional mass we enjoy now is a far cry from the state of it in the late 1950s. And I know this because I have relatives who were in their 20s at this time and saw first hand the attitude of many clergy. These clergy didn't disappear suddenly after the council (though many did) - these were the ones who adopted the Novus Ordo with gusto. And in whose legacy, many were unfortunately trapped."

1krj2ga,How to respond to this accusation against Abp. Lefebvre?,mte8vg0,Duibhlinn,11,"The insinuations that Archbishop Lefebvre was some sort of national socialist are ridiculous and as you point out deeply insulting to a man whose family was murdered in a German death camp for being a member of the French Resistance to the German occupiers. The Archbishop was a Catholic, and if anything was a highly reactionary monarchist like his father Ren√© was. Archbishop Lefebvre, as far as I know, supported a restoration of the monarchy in France. The German ideology is another strain of modern liberalism to which all traditional Catholics have always been opposed.For foreigners, especially non Europeans and most especially Americans they generally haven't got a clue what actually happened in France between 1940 and 1945. Marshal P√©tain wasn't a ""nazi regime collaborator"". I mean you no offence but this is a child's understanding of modern history.Marshal P√©tain was a war hero from the First World War having been Commander in Chief of the French army. 1 week before France was defeated by Germany the French Prime Minister resigned and made a request to the French President, Lebrun, that P√©tain be appointed Prime Minister to help the government deal with the crisis. The government agreed and P√©tain was appointed, by the French President and government, to be the last Prime Minister of the Third French Republic.When France was finally totally defeated by Germany the government, including Prime Minister P√©tain, negotiated terms of surrender with the Germans. They managed to negotiate surrender terms where the Germans would directly occupy the northern half of France but would allow the southern half of the country a degree of self rule and autonomy, the legal entity of the French state continuing to exist but being basically under the thumb of the Germans, similar to how Poland and Hungary were technically independent countries after World War 2 but were de facto controlled by the Russians.P√©tain is a controversial figure. Some French people think he worked with the German occupying enemy. Other French people think he did his best to preserve what little autonomy the French government could maintain, and protected the southern half of the country from being directly occupied and controlled by the Germans. Regardless of one's opinion on P√©tain, the intention of his actions was to preserve that remained of France and to allow the country to survive without being totally destroyed by the Germans who had completely defeated them.There were actual French collaborators at the time, people who were directly and intentionally collaborating with the Germans, not those who were doing what P√©tain and his government were trying to do. The German army and SS was full of divisions and brigades made up exclusively of French and also Bretons, such as the Charlemagne Brigade and the Bezen Perrot.Something important to understand if you're not European and familiar with southern France during World War 2 is that the Catholic Church was very supportive of P√©tain and his government. The fight with the Germans was over, they had lost badly, but P√©tain and his government attempted to do their best to build a Catholic France in the territory the Germans hadn't taken from them. The Church made Her position clear, and issued statements telling all French Catholics that it was their obligation to support Marshal P√©tain and his government and that his government was the legitimate French government (i.e. not the Germans). French Bishops even went so far as to say that the French should obey P√©tain, not General de Gaulle who was attempting to restore the Freemasonic French Republic. Notably, and you most likely won't have heard this, in the early years of P√©tain's prime ministership the government voted to basically roll back the French Revolution. They renamed the state to the French State, or just France, rather than the French Republic and they even got rid of ""Liberty, Equality, Fraternity"" and replaced it with ""Work, Family, Fatherland"". P√©tain's Catholic government undid all the anti-Church laws passed since the 1700s and gave all the Church property that had been stolen by the Republic back to the Church. They passed laws allowing religion to once again be let back into public schools, and allowing public funds to fund Catholic schools once again.P√©tain was no perfect man. He wasn't really practising, ""married"" a divorcee and had multiple affairs during his life that produced no children. He did, however, with his government roll back much of the French Revolution and that is why so many European traditional Catholics think positively of him. Far from being a nazi collaborator, the Germans actually illegally arrested P√©tain who under the law was a foreign head of state and abducted him, taking him and deporting him against his will to Germany where he was basically a prisoner. P√©tain was motivated by an attempt to restore Catholicism, despite his personal failings, and to prevent France's total destruction at the hands of the Germans.To the French who think positively of P√©tain, the Marshal and his government were victims of the Germans, not active participants in nazi German collaborationism. The Church made their opinion on the southern French state quite clear and have since then received mountains of criticism for their support, up to and including popes Pius XI and Pius XII. P√©tain isn't an exact 1:1 to Franco but he is in some ways the French version of general Franco.>Honestly though I can imagine Bishop Williamson having these views since he publicly denied the holocaust and got kicked out of the SSPX for refusing to stop commenting on it among other things.A correction on this, Bishop Williamson wasn't expelled from the SSPX for his view on World War 2. He was sanctioned basically for a lack of obedience to his lawful superiors. He administered over 100 confirmations in Brazil without permission, and against instruction from his superiors which was one of the big acts of disobedience. Another was when he circulated an open letter calling for the Superior General to resign. His World War 2 views were certainly not universally shared but they were ultimately besides the point, he was expelled for disobedience. The Society put out a statement basically saying that Bishop Williamson had gradually distanced himself from the Society's leadership and government over a period of a few years and refused to show the respect and obedience deserved by his legitimate superiors. You can probably find the letter online if you search for it."
1krj2ga,How to respond to this accusation against Abp. Lefebvre?,mtkrosf,asimovsdog,2,"The quotes are true. It's not hard to believe, because Marshal Petain and the Vichy Regime weren't the bad evil guys you're indoctrinated to think they are. What should Lefebvre have backed instead: the liberal Jewish communists of the 1920s or the social-communist Jewish-Russian atheists? Lefebvres father was convicted to death because he was a spy for British intelligence, any other nation did the same to spies, and worse.Nazis mainly removed the Judeo-Masonic Republican government that occupied France in the 1920s and left France mostly to itself during their ""occupation"" (more of a liberation, really). They even respected France so much that any soldier raping French women was put to death (can't say that about the Russians). 1920s France was EXTREMELY degenerate, same as Weimar Germany, thanks to the ruling Jews. So, of course Lefebvre backed Petain, Franco and collaboration with the Nazi regime over collaboration with Russian communism and liberal degeneracy. Because if the Nazis / Francoists are known for one thing, it's that they absolutely hated degeneracy, unlike the communists.The Nazis didn't have particularly Catholic ideals, I'll give you that - but they to some extent at least respected the Church / Christianity to exist (unlike liberals and the Jewish communists). Now please don't cite me the misguided Pius XIs bull, who himself engaged in Ostpolitik with Russian communists, nerfed the Cristeros by promoting compromise (thanks to Gasparri) and falsely excommunicated the Action Francaise (Pius XII kindly reverted that mistake, but by that point it was too late). Pius XI condemned nationalism and thought he could ""talk it out"" with the communists, only to leave a complete mess to his successor who had to find out the hard way that communists simply demand more concessions if you give them what you want. Anyone who will now post ""mit brennender sorge"" to paint Nazi Germany as the supposed mortal enemy of Catholicism will get ignored until he [reads up on some more history on Pius XI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VimsP2I-uFE). The more I study Pius XI, the worse it gets, really. One cannot be nice to communists and at the same time further Catholicism, it doesn't work. That's not an endorsement of NatSoc, by the way.Lots of people are still so brainwashed on ""muh Nazis are literally devils murdering anyone while Jews were innocent lambs who did nothing"", it's amazing how deep the brainwashing goes. Lefebvre was simply redpilled on the fact that Judeo-Communist Masonry hates the guts of Catholic monarchy, so obviously he backed Petain / Franco (both monarchist) rather than de Gaulle (a Republican) and saw collaboration with Nazi Germany as the lesser problem to Catholicism. Williamson continued that and spoke the truth about the Jews - obviously that will get you hated in the modern world, which is sadly controlled by Jews.Lefevbre did preach on the Judeo-Masonry and on freemasons in Econe, but obviously the Fellayite-SSPX won't tell you that anymore, since they believe in Holocaustianism and being nice to Jews. So currently (post 2012), they just try to ignore the issue, thinking they can play both sides. It really comes down to whether you believe the mainstream Holocaust narrative, and that's it. Once you start questioning that, both Lefebvre and Williamsons actions start to make sense. If you still believe the Jews are innocent little lambs slaughtered by the bad evil Nazis, then I can't help you and you'll never understand Lefebvres quotes. But they don't need to be ""excused"" or ""defended"", both of them spoke the truth."
1krj2ga,How to respond to this accusation against Abp. Lefebvre?,mtegdp4,Ferrari_Fan_16,4,"Well that makes sense. The media and history would certainly like to make a fool of a man who loved the Church and his country. And in order to do so they would have to lie about 2 different people. Not the first time history has used masonry and liberalism to demonize the church for something (the inquisition for example is not hard to support if you have the Catholic faith). If you do any kind of search of P√©tain you will hear the words ‚Äúnazi collaborator‚Äù over and over again no matter where you look so that‚Äôs unfortunately where I got that from.And I knew Williamson was mainly in trouble for other things concerning the society. I‚Äôm not anti Bishop Williamson either, I know he had the faith and he did good things for the Church but I don‚Äôt think the SSPX was wrong for removing him either given the circumstances. I also know Williamson wasn‚Äôt expelled for his views specifically, but his refusal to stop talking about them publicly and in his newsletter were just one example of his unlawful disobedience to SSPX superiors.It just wasn‚Äôt adding up for me that Lefebvre did what the media says he did. It‚Äôs quite impossible actually."
1krj2ga,How to respond to this accusation against Abp. Lefebvre?,mteg1bu,Blade_of_Boniface,3,"This is an excellent overview of a complicated topic. Nazis have replaced demons in the secular imagination. Many find it hard to actually imagine people at the time existing within a specific historical context. Their thinking is Cartesian: ""Either they were for Hitler or they were against him!"" Roman Catholics (whether historians consider them traditionalist, conservative, liberal, or otherwise) were consistently harsh critics of Hitler and the NSDAP even if this had to be balanced by:1. **Threat of a fascist [Kulturkampf](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08703b.htm) -** The German government and various anticlerical factions had already tried to systematically erase Catholicism from public/economic life. They *failed* but not for lack of enthusiasm. Meanwhile the NSDAP welcomed Lutherans, Calvinists, neopagans, atheists, agnostics, Gnostics, and [literal occultists.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thule_Society) The strongest bases of support were in the most anti-Catholic areas and vice versa. Hitler himself vacillated between affirming all Germans' religious freedom and proclaiming that Christianity was a ""Jewish slave creed"" and expressing praise for Islam's ""warriors."" 2. **Potential for the USSR to expand -** The French Revolution already facilitated a continent-straddling campaign to supplant the Roman Catholic Church and put [deism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism#Deism_in_France_and_continental_Europe) (among other bad ideas) in the place of Christianity. Communism (rightfully) seemed roughly as scheming and ill-advised. The Russian Civil War produced numerous horror stories of murder and torture. During the Spanish Civil War, anarchists were burning down farms and small businesses while Leninists were promising to seize every bit of life and land from those with holy orders. The KPD didn't seem like a lesser evil to European Christians. 3. **Fear of a Second Great War -** World War I was extremely destructive and traumatic. Not since the [European Wars of Religion](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14648b.htm) had people seen such destruction. It's easy to be an armchair general and say that the Third Reich should've been confronted sooner/harder, but even the USSR who saw Germany as their worst geopolitical competitor carefully stalled so that their system could industrialize, the Red Army could further militarize, and Soviet agents could ply allies around the world. The Roman Catholic Church herself had her ability to act as international authority progressively whittled away for decades in the name of nationalism/liberalism/commercialism. I could make this list longer but these are the three biggest reasons. SSPX has denounced the French Revolution for good reason. One can draw a line from Luther to Robespierre to Bismarck to Hitler."

1krj2ga,How to respond to this accusation against Abp. Lefebvre?,mtenm5m,Duibhlinn,3,"Thank you, and your post is a great contribution to the discussion as always. I agree with everything you've posted. The Church has always been surrounded by enemies on all sides yes, no one denies that, but that took a more active and direct sense after the protestant rebellion. In the aftermath of the First World War the Church was truly under siege by numerous hostile enemies. The Church was like a man locked in a prison cell with 3 felons: liberalism, communism and national socialist / fascist ideology, all of whom are in a 3 way fight to the death, meanwhile the Church is trying to both defend itself and avoid getting hit or caught in the crossfire in this death struggle. The only thing that changed after world war 2 was that the death struggle lost 1 participant and became a 2 man fight, both of whom still totally hostile to the Church.Every single one of the ideologies that were battling for supremacy between World War 1 and the end of World War 2 were children of the French Revolution and its liberalism, who were themselves children of the protestant rebellion. They all changed over time but on the genetic tree they originated from the exact same poisonous point.Catholics during this period did all they could do, their best. Late in the war when the Germans took more direct control over Italy it became even more difficult of a situation. The Germans basically turned the pope and the Vatican into a hostage. There were [SS plans to invade the Vatican, sack it, steal all of the valuables, arrest the pope and kidnap him to Germany](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-5XSCiBHms). The more things change, the more they stay the same. The Papacy in Rome has for most of its history been surrounded by hostile powers trying to kill each other, and sometimes trying to kill the Papacy. There's very little difference between barbaric pagan German tribes killing each other over who gets to loot the corpse of the Western Roman Empire and.... barbaric pagan German tribes wearing SS uniforms using the Colosseum as an arms dump.The whole nazis as demons thing is quite accurate, it's essentially an American new age religion. And, especially egregiously among Catholics, it fails to recognise that the German side in that three way death struggle is not the only one that was hostile to the Church. The other two also were, and still are. The forces that vanquished them are even worse enemies to the Church in many ways, especially the communist side of the conflict.At the end of the day you have to wonder, what exactly do some of these ideologues want the pope to have done? He is the vicar of Christ, not a global dictator whose job it is to personally step in every time an unhinged madman whose brain is tainted by an ideological fruit of the French Revolution goes on a rampage. We as Catholics don't believe in utopianism, or that it is even possible to have a utopia on Earth. We know these sufferings won't end. What our primary job here is is to preserve the Church and the faith, regardless of how badly the society deteriorates philosophically, politically and ideologically. Minds tainted by libralism cannot comprehend this."
1krj2ga,How to respond to this accusation against Abp. Lefebvre?,mtejxqn,Duibhlinn,6,"A good point and I agree with you. I have a great deal of respect and admiration for the Archbishop, more than I have for almost any other bishop of the past half a century bar perhaps Bishop de Castro Mayer of Campos in Brazil. However it's important to not let our admiration for those we consider to be great men to cloud our minds.Archbishop Lefebvre wasn't perfect, nobody is, and I know that's obvious but it's important to keep ourselves grounded and in touch with reality. Like looking at a bright light can make it hard to see in the shadows, the heroic actions of those we consider to be great men can make it more difficult to see their flaws. I do think that he was a holy man, and a heroic great man figure, but he wasn't a demigod and it's not only unrealistic but also unfair to treat his memory as if he was. No one can hold up to the standard of perfection and it's in a way uncharitable to try to hold someone to that.The fact that we are flawed beings is what makes acts, and lives, of heroic greatness even more admirable. Heroic virtue practised by an angelic being of pure goodness is far less admirable than the same being managed by a being who has to struggle against original sin."

Catholics are principled pillars of their community embodying the love of Christ when they give women and children aid but Catholics are treated as clericalist cretins when they say that abortion is hostile to womanhood and childhood. They may even see the *former* as unacceptably intrusive. I suspect this is a factor behind how a lot of United States' Roman Catholic organizations are under the sway of social democrats, liberals, and neoconservatives. Classical conservatism, social traditionalism, and post-liberalism are treated like black sheep of public-facing church life. The winds may be turning though."

1kqp4qz,Is a Sedevacantist confession valid?,mtkwz79,asimovsdog,3,"Well it would be definitely licit, because the jurisdiction (for all sacraments) doesn't come from the Pontiff, but from emergency jurisdiction, because of the obvious Crisis in the Church. Same justification as the SSPX, although the SSPX tries to sweep that under the rug, under Fellay they tried to go back under modernist Romes jurisdiction, although not all agreed. Bishop de Gallereta once called that ""gift"" by Rome ""a poison pill"", as I've been told, because it changes the jurisdiction from ""emergency"" back to the Pontiff, as if the emergency is over and can be simply ignored.Now, I don't recommend going to sedevacantists (sedes are wrong, but that's another topic), but since the confession is licit (thanks to emergency), it depends on whether the priest is a valid priest. CMRI priests are Thuc-line, which derive their priests from Guerard de Lauriers. [Thuc line bishops are definitely valid](https://archive.is/wip/OysPa), there's an extensive examination by Bp. Sanborn on the ""doubts"" that have been raised. The problem are the scandals in that line, but that doesn't affect validity.I would say: don't go unless you absolutely have to (i.e. mortal sin). Lefevbre warned us from sedevacantism and for good reason."

And the book says, ""I like this,"" and there are only two points of decree: one is, from now on, there are four Eucharistical Prayers. It doesn't say we have to use them. It says, ""There are four Eucharistical Prayers, and I want the formula of consecration, the words of consecration, to be the same in all forms.""

Go read Pius X on How the Pope should be loved.Here are a few more quotes from various popes, councils and the systematic index of a book called ""The Church"" by the Benedictine Monks of Solesmes regarding the true nature of the papacy:""the supreme teacher in the Church is the Roman Pontiff""""this See of St. Peter always remains unblemished by any error""""this gift of truth and never-failing faith was therefore divinely conferred on Peter and his successors""""No man can contemn the primacy without destroying the constitution of the Church and compromising his eternal salvation""""The Pope is...Vicar of Christ...and with Him making but one single head of the Church""""When we hear the voice of the Pope, we hear the very voice of Christ Himself...even in the 'ordinary' teaching authority""""This 'ordinary' teaching, e.g., which is to be found in Encyclicals, requires assent""""This ordinary magisterium is of divine authority and is infallible""""It is an error to believe that one can adhere to Christ while rejecting His Vicar on earth""""the teaching and the decisions of the Apostolic See are binding on all men, and are not subject to scrutiny""""no distinction between the pope of the past and the pope of the present moment""""the priest must place in his first rank of duties that of obedience to the Pope""""We do not oppose to the pope's authority that of other persons-no matter how learned""""for where there is holiness, there cannot be disagreement with the Pope""""Union of minds, therefore, requires, together with a perfect accord in the one faith, complete submission and obedience of will to the Church and to the Roman Pontiff, as to God Himself.‚Äù""We declare, say, define, and pronounce that it is absolutely necessary for the salvation of every human creature to be subject to the Roman Pontiff""The idea that the Ordinary Magisterium is only infallible when it repeats what is already defined is false and has been condemned by Pius XII in Humani Generis. The idea that Peter can teach error, even heresy, is false. The idea that the Church can make use of ceremonies that lead to impiety is condemned by anathema at Trent. Scrutinizing Peter is condemned. The idea that the Church can provide harmful discipline is condemned.At this point we're not even discussing the ""private"" errors of a pope. We're discussing public official encyclicals containing heresy, councils, codes of canon law, official catechisms, canonizations made with supreme authority (go read the actual text and don't buy the lie that is the process), and the list goes on. Why do you insist on having a pope who you refuse submission to precisely because he isn't Catholic? It's kind of insane. Please show one document of the Church which says to sift the Teaching of Peter.Casti Connubii104. Wherefore, let the faithful also be on their guard against the overrated independence of private judgment and that false autonomy of human reason. For it is quite foreign to everyone bearing the name of a Christian to trust his own mental powers with such pride as to agree only with those things which he can examine from their inner nature, and to imagine that the Church, sent by God to teach and guide all nations, is not conversant with present affairs and circumstances; or even that they must obey only in those matters which she has decreed by solemn definition as though her other decisions might be presumed to be false or putting forward insufficient motive for truth and honesty. Quite to the contrary, a characteristic of all true followers of Christ, lettered or unlettered, is to suffer themselves to be guided and led in ALL things that touch upon faith or morals by the Holy Church of God through its Supreme Pastor the Roman Pontiff, who is himself guided by Jesus Christ Our Lord. (Emphasis added: capitalized ALL)I remain faithfully yours in the Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart."

If you want an accurate barometer you should make a post with a poll, and I guarantee you that more than 2 people on this subreddit have an issue with the status quo: the fact that the moderation has allowed it to be overrun with spam, anti-Catholic thinly veiled hate posts from people who clearly hate us. I have found this influx to be highly offputting from reading the subreddit recently.>There‚Äôs also nothing wrong with leaving up low effort content like that because it‚Äôs an opportunity to demonstrate Catholic charity in our responses.We should be charitable to those with addiction issues for example, but it is not sane nor charitable to allow the local drug addicts to move into your front garden and turn it into a dangerous drug den. We are the children in the house in this analogy and you, the moderator, are the parent who is justifying allowing the local drug addicts to begin setting up a drug den outside our bedroom window.There is also a massive difference between ""low effort content"" as you call it and what the actual issue here is, thinly veiled hate content. These are troll posts written by people who, if you take 5 seconds and check their post history, clearly hate us. A low effort post from someone who could have easily googled the answer is not the same thing as deliberate attempts to derail a subreddit with troll posts. The former is indeed an opportunity to exercise charity, but the latter is a different matter entirely and the two are nothing alike."

1knd0v4,Help for friend,mshgbx7,mineuserbane,4,Someone like that needs the sacraments to heal. You're asking if a consultation with a doctor will heal someone who needs medication but isn't willing to take it. Doctors advice will not heal when you need medication. Exorcism is for possession. Sexual dreams are not possession. That seems more like an overactive libido being denied. Normal concupiscence. Regular Catholic sacraments and continual self denial will heal that. Christ instituted Confession and the Eucharist for this.  Your friend is rejecting the medication required to heal.
1knd0v4,Help for friend,mskmlxf,None,2,This he just needs confession and the sacraments.
1knd0v4,Help for friend,msyu3ul,No-Test6158,1,"You are right in thinking that exorcism is rare - but this has always been the case. The dreams you've described sound normal to me. We've all had dreams where we've woken up and are grateful that it was just a dream. I know I've had all sorts. Things where I've broken the law and everything is falling apart, things where I've sinned against the 6th commandment in particularly nasty ways. It's just a dream. Holding onto them is like trying to hold onto sand. Your friend needs counselling from a decent, Catholic counsellor (a lot of secular counsellors will just try and bring out the anti-religious spiel) and he needs your prayers and compassion to help him come back to the church!And regarding the topic of exorcism, there is a process. Every diocese has an exorcist who will lead this. Often working with mental health professionals in order to discern who genuinely needs spiritual intervention.SSPX priests *can* do this but they will most likely refer to the diocese. In any case, most SSPX priests are immensely busy!"

If sources of error are plentiful, such as they would be in a society in which Catholics are the minority or in which there is a significant non-Catholic population, or in which contact with non-Catholics is common, then executing public heretics would do nothing to preserve souls because they would be insignificant compared to all of the other sources of error.Also just to make sure you understand the history here.

Not sure how many responses you will get as I am unsure how many other Walton SSPXers are on Reddit. My take:I am very pleased with the school. It is not perfect, but no school is. My family moved here a little over three years ago from Southern California and we are very happy here. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it was an adjustment, but well worth it. I also have some experience with the Dominican girls school across the street as well. Honestly, both schools are great. Your children will not get a ‚Äúworld class education‚Äù and the only thing constant is growth and change. However, with proper perspective on the world, The Church, and everything in between, I think that this school is great. The teachers are very good in my opinion. DM me if you want to chat more.

It is unjust and imprudent to begin condemning a newly elected pope before he has acted in his papal office.Archbishop Lefebvre never condemned Pope John Paul II until he observed actions, and even the SSPX waited to critique Pope Francis until his words and deeds.We should really not be posting an obese retard that is literally wearing a fedora judging the pope by presuption."
1kiw03y,The Rise of Francis 2.0 by the Catholic Esquire,mruhv1a,Street-Tree-8126,1,I I watched this and made a detailed summary of the points he make and wether they seem to make sense or not. One thing I noted is he says American are rebellious in nature as if that was a good thing when it comes to religion. Rebellion in religion has led to either sedevacantism or Protestantism. Overall I think he‚Äôs having too much of a conspiratorial tone to describe it all. He exaggerates. Apparently he‚Äôs long been in the political sphere and it explains a lot of his over the top take on scheming in the conclave.

The Pope is the Pope even if he isnt catholic, until the see reconizes that. Also Saint Robert would never defend a layman to reconize and judge the heresy on The Papacy. Futhermore RCR is as old as Saint Athanasius, we are not examining things we just dont obey when a Pope wants to disobey the ordinary universal magisterium. For Pastor aeternus also says the autority of the Pope is to judge tradition not invent new doctrine, therefore the see is always unblemished for the Catholic church was built to have errors never be binding, and the sspx is catholic and you are a apostate. For the cardinals were appointed by valid Popes, and we cannot see nor judge without a speck of doubt that the Popes in vatican wished to apostate knowing they were teaching heresy against something the church considerated imutable, and even if they did per canon law they would be juridically the Pope, but their decrees would not be binding, for the autority is from Chirst not from the man in the see. thats nonsense and you are insane."

Furthermore we even had a 20 year old as Pope, we had 3 Popes, we had a Pope which made a male prostitute as a cardinal, we had a Pope killed for adultery, we had a Pope use his autority to judge a corpse, and yet you think the see is vacant only now?

Since the ordinary universal magisterium(infalliable) is evident throught history, and the saints teach Papal resistence in error, either your wrong about this reading or the whole church MOU throught ages got contradicted by Pius XI.Furthermore if thats your criteria you should reject benedict XV whose avoided excomunicating heretics, and Pius XII whose elected people you call manifest heretics for vatican 2, and thr list goes on, until we get in the middle ages"

1kdj84n,Why aren't you a sedevacantist?,mqc28ys,USAFrenchMexRadTrad,9,Good question. Not sure why you're getting downvoted. The sedevacantists fail to make a distinction between material and formal heresy. That's a big one. They're writing the death sentence of their own groups. It establishes a precedent that they can't work away from.
1kdj84n,Why aren't you a sedevacantist?,mqbe8se,ViveChristusRex,11,"I attend a Pre-55 Church run by the ICKSP, although I am sympathetic to the SSPX and many of its holy and reverent priests. I am not a sedevacantist because all of the various sedevacantist, sedeprivationist, and conclavist groups fail to present a clear solution for the future (I guess the latter provides a solution, even though it is wrong). Furthermore, the division between the various sedevacantist groups makes everything even more confusing. I think the sheer disunity in the movement as a whole speaks for itself. Finally, like Dr. Taylor Marshall once said, ‚Äúeven if the waters are rough, you don‚Äôt jump off the ark, because otherwise you will drown.‚Äù I believe that‚Äîeven though the previous Pontificate was confusing and disastrous for tradition‚Äîwe never leave Jesus because of Judas, or the Church because of wolves in sheep‚Äôs clothing. Even though sedevacantists are often some of the most zealous, pious, and devoted people in terms of religious fervor (which makes their entire movement appear tempting), I believe their core beliefs and claims are flawed to such a degree that I do not see their assertions as a possibility."

Or was St. Thomas Aquinas a heretic for denying the Immaculate Conception? Hindsight is 20/20, sure. But I really do think the clergy have gotten watered down versions of doctrine and can't fully be blamed for being somewhat heterodox on some points of doctrine.The postV2 Popes haven't tried to impose errors on others, and that may lend credence to them being antiPopes if they did. But even the Novus Ordo sacraments were just made ""available for use"". The bishops made the decision to switch but there was no anathema, no declaration or command to use the new sacraments.The insidiousness of Modernism is that the vague statements and versions of doctrine that are left open to interpretation are left in a sort of critical thinking limbo, and clergy who were raised by and surrounded by those who would teach with that mindset wouldn't know any better.^ That's most Catholics now. It sucks. But you can't make up someone else's mind for them.One big problem with sedevacantists is that they see themselves as the last real Catholics, and the danger there is that this mindset makes them feel justified to be jerks.I know a sedevacantist who seems to impose his opinion on the SSPX over what the SSPX actually says. He doesn't really understand their positions. Hee was raised in a sedevacantist Church and I think his wife was too. I've been trying to learn about the crisis in the Church since I found out about it in 2005. He seems to think I'll jump over to his side of the fence and he's only known me since 2024."

Pope Benedict XVI didn't ""undo"" what JP2 did, so much as provide recognition that the excommunications weren't valid to begin with.    If they were ""removed"", which they weren't, the SSPX would have had to recant to be reconciled.  The SSPX hasn't changed their position, rather the Vatican under Benedict XVI had to recognize the mistake made under JP2.

Anyone who cannot accept the possibility of unapproved consecrations might as well just head down to their local Ecclesia Dei group chapel right now. No need to wait.

1k99cfj,Where to start,mpcv140,SnowWhiteFeather,11,"Happy sunday! I am happy to hear about your conversion.The Baltimore Catechism is commonly used for covering the basics of Catholic education. (Not particular to the SSPX)When I converted our priest used ""This is the Faith"" by Canon Francis Ripley for my catechism. It was an excellent book. It is written for converts, especiallyfrom a protestant background. (Not particular to the SSPX)My wife says that ""The Catechism Explained"" by Rev. Francis Spirago is oriented toward an adult audience.(Not particular to the SSPX)Archbishop Lefebvre (the founder of the SSPX) wrote a book that is free as an audiobook on YouTube called ""An Open Letter to Confused Catholics"". It is a fairly short book that is definitely worth reading or listening to.The ""SSPX News"" YouTube channel is a good resource. I particularly like the ""Crisis in the Church"" series. It isn't really a news channel as I would think of it.Mere Tradition with Kennedy Hall is another YouTube channel that does a good job of covering news and various topics.

1k7u6xg,Modern saints,mp10gn4,Duibhlinn,11,"Episode 45 of the Crisis in the Church series of lectures on the SSPX YouTube channel covers this exact topic.[Crisis Series #45: Are the New Canonizations Infallible?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI9FVR2Dfbc)>Don Tranquillo will join us once again to look at the question of Canonizations since the time of the Second Vatican Council. Are the New Canonizations infallible? To answer this, we‚Äôll need to see whether or not Canonizations in the past were infallible. It‚Äôs commonly understood by most Catholics that Canonizations are one of the things that are infallibly proclaimed by the Pope. How then can we square this seeming infallibility with some of the new saints, who contradict previous saints?>Note: This is one way of looking at the issue - theologians, in the last 250 years have had varied opinions on the infallibility of canonizations. It is still today, both in traditional and Vatican circles, debated.This is the best explanation of the topic I've personally seen. The only difficulty you may have is Don Tranquillo's strong Italian accent.A brief summary is that since the entire canonisation process was changed under the pontificate of John Paul II, it's not the same thing that's being talked about in sources such as Saint Thomas Aquinas' writings on the infallability of canonisations. The new process is more doubtful than the previous one as a result, and due to that element of doubt (and until a truly traditional pope comes in and says yes, no, yes, no while going through the list of recent canonisations) it's imprudent to publicly venerate such people declared saints under the new rules. They may be saints, and it's perfectly fine to for example privately venerate Padre Pio and pray for his intercession, but public veneration due to that element of doubt is not prudent."

1k7u6xg,Modern saints,mp4mlfi,Murky_Question_9362,2,Exactly
1k7u6xg,Modern saints,mp3mx48,tradrcrthings,3,Because Padre Pio still celebrated Tridentine Mass until his death in 1968 despite of ongoing promulgation of Novus Ordo and he vigorously refused to to accept Vatican II reforms. That's why he still acknowledged as Saint within SSPX circle.
1k7u6xg,Modern saints,mp6gt3q,MitthrawnuruodoVCR,1,"no offense but that is fake news. completely made up. the novus ordo wasnt even completed in 1970, in many cases the 1965 interim mass was not required especially of those old and infirm. No one would make a old holy celebrity priest begin a new mass at the end of his life.   Do you have any source that says Padre Pio stated an opinion on v2?    Don't you think it appears acceptable to venerate him because Padre Pio bi-located, levitated and had the stigmata lol. If this is how cult-minded you think the SSPX is about saints and canonization, and simply refusing V2/NOM make one near perfect, you must have a very rotten perspective of SSPX and Lefebvre."

1k7rigd,My dad says that one of the problems with the modern catholic church is that it allows freedom of religion?,mp0k7jg,None,10,"Hi!This is a huge subject, but I hope I'll be able to sum it up.What is freedom? For us moderns, the most common definition is ""the right to do whatever I want as long as I don't step on anyone else's freedom.""If you think of it though, it doesn't really make any sense; because it would mean that preventing someone from doing something that's bad for him would mean reducing his freedom. Also, what exactly is the limit of how much you can't step on other people's freedom? Because insulting someone is part of my free speech; but one could argue he has a right not to be insulted; so where exactly is the limit? Well, there isn't one, that's the thing: people aren't bubbles walking around, we live in a society, every action we have, no matter how personal, has consequences, big or small, on society.This is why the traditional definition of freedom is: ""the ability to do chose what's good"".So, not letting someone chose something that's wrong for them (like for example, not letting a kid eating too much candy, or not letting a man commit suicide) isn't limiting their freedom.That doesn't mean enforcing people to do what's good is always the good thing to do, sometimes it's even counter productive.So that's the problem of ""freedom of religion""; it implies that a Catholic state has a moral duty to accept any false religion and to let people spread it, no matter how evil that false religion is. And if you think of it, all of them are evil, since they lead people away from the true religion. Traditionally, the Catholic church accepts to ""tolerate"" an evil only when repressing it would be a greater evil (which is a common thing actually). A famous example is saint king Louis IX who wanted to close brothels; this ended up making prostitution even worse, because it was happening in the streets and getting out of control, so he decided to ""tolerate"" it (tolerate in the traditional sense I explained).So yes, before our time, everyone in the world believed that it wouldn't make sense to have a moral duty to accept anything false and evil.That's why freedom of religion is wrong, but forced conversions are wrong too; there is a difference between banning a cult and forcing its believers to get baptized!If you don't agree with a part of what I said or if you want more explanation, don't hesitate!"
1k7rigd,My dad says that one of the problems with the modern catholic church is that it allows freedom of religion?,mp0j1hr,dbaughmen,8,"‚ÄúFreedom of religion‚Äù means giving rights to other religions and say other religions are acceptable and ‚Äúhold some of the Truth of the Catholic Faith‚Äù (as some of the modern popes say). This is blasphemous, as the Catholic Church of all time teaches that only *Truth* has rights, only the Catholic Church has the right to exist. As Catholics, we are called to tolerate other religions and their existence, but not embrace them. This is practically one of the main problems with the ‚Äúmodern‚Äù church. God bless!"

All power and authority come from God, and only from God's One True Church can anyone learn to properly make use of either.So, the state must recognize that, in order to survive, it's use of power and authority must be guided by truth, and only in the Church that God gave us can we find the greatest fullness of truth on this side of creation. The state must look to the Church and it would only serve to, ultimately, undo and cause harm to the state to allow the spread of error."

That is what is going on in the Church right now.Our babysitter is telling us that religious freedom is a moral good and that all faiths contain truth, which contradicts the authority of past Popes and Church teaching.It has previously been taught that there is no salvation outside of the Church. If you do not come to the Church and die in a state of grace you will go to Hell.Everyone has free will. They can choose to accept Christ or deny Him. People who don't have access to the Church still have this choice, even if they may have far fewer graces. They still have grace sufficient to make the proper choice. In cases where people are seperated from the Church and have sought after God there have been wonderful miracles that brought them into the Church.Because people have free will the Church teaches that it is wrong to coerce people into being religious, which is not the same as freedom of religion.This is an excellent video that covers the topic:https://youtu.be/AoZPouA8jxc?si=iGPMHhFXJol3d4NWThis is probably the most difficult Church teaching. I struggled to accept it until I focused on what I know about God. He is merciful, He is loving, He is infinitely more intelligent than we are. We can depend on Him to judge justly. We cannot trust ourselves and our fallen human nature to judge justly. We should always strive to use our rationality and intellect to understand and love God, but we are blind by comparison to Him."
1k7rigd,My dad says that one of the problems with the modern catholic church is that it allows freedom of religion?,mp22954,asimovsdog,2,"Nobody can be forced to believe against conscience (conversion at gunpoint scenario), but Vatican II goes in the 100% opposite extreme, saying that false religions such as Islam, Orthodoxy, thousands of Protestant sects (esp. Pentecostalism) and, by logical exension, even Satanism have a ""right to exist"". However, error non habet ius - error has no rights. The state is subordinate to the morals of the Church, as the goal of the state is to be an institution that leads people to heaven. It can't force people to convert, but it can certainly nudge people, promote Catholicism in schools, courts, censor books against the Faith, ban indecency, etc. The core of this problem goes a lot deeper, starting with the Hegelian evolution of history, evolution of dogma, Napoleon separating Church and state, the new ""living tradtion"" nonsense that has infiltrated the Church for the past 300 years, etc. Your Dad is both correct and slightly wrong: freedom of religion is a symptom, the real problem is modernism (read Pascendi) or rather the rejection that absolute truth exists, whether I want it to or not. The modern Church thinks that religion is a subjective experience that is evolving and therefore we need to make the Church nice and welcoming so that everyone has a nice experience. Religion now comes from ""within"", from my personal experience of whatever I perceive to be. Therefore, we need a democratic church, as the faith now comes from the believers experiences, not from authority. That's a rough summary of modernism. What is right or wrong doesn't matter anymore as religion is merely an experience: of course other religions have their religious experiences, therefore they are all a-ok and deserve to exist. ""But that won't lead souls to heav..."" - oh shut up grandpa, nobody believes in that superstitious nonsense anymore."

Some of the problem is ignorance and some of the problem is an unwillingness to correct in light of the truth.It is the same as it has always been. Christ is persecuted and those who follow Him are persecuted in his likeness.I have found that the extent of the willingness to listen is commensurate with how aware they are of the crisis in the Church. The culture does seem to be slowly shifting in favor of tradition, though. I know in our parish we have been seeing a rise in attendance generally and from people from the NO, while the NO has continued to lose attendance. We have even had a fairly reasonable amount of conversions ‚Äìmyself being included among them.Considering that the SSPX is the largest traditional group, that they are growing at a fast rate, and could be growing faster if we had the priests I think we can be hopeful of even larger victories in the near future.It is the continued effort at dialogue that is bringing people in, so I would encourage Father to continue engaging where he can if he is inclined.

Speaking with those that attend NO, they'll regard fssp as a bit holier than thou and either have never heard of sspx or label sspx incorrectly as schismatic etc. Fssp people council me to just get baptised before worrying about my level of traditionalism but either speak of sspx as the same kind of hollier than thou as the NO says of fssp or, they wish the sspx chapel wasn't hours away. It's like FSSP is the gateway to SSPX to an NO parishioner and each one is just a step up or down the ""self righteous"" ladder. Then there are those I talk with that attend SSPX that tell me I'm so lucky to have never attended NO and I have the chance to come into the church via the SSPX. That even FSSP is selling myself short. OrNO people telling me SSPX isn't a valid pathway into the church. In saying all that, ive encountered more staunch and steadfast NO people than either of the other two. More willing to argue thier case where as FSSP and SSPX in general urge me to pray on my options to decide. With a handful of the strongly motivated staunch types steering me away from NO. It's funny to me as it's so typical of human behaviour to pick a ""team"" and stand by it.In actuality, I find the same mix of likeable/less likeable people in any of the groups.What I've seen of NO mass though, reminded me of Anglican services and that put me off and I wasn't sure if eastern orthodox wasn't my option. I don't take my ""having found God"" lightly. My heart and head tells me it's very important to connect back to the begining as completly as possible. I've read and researched a lot as is my style and I think I have a better grasp on church history that 99% of NO attendee's I've met and am friends with. And I'm about 50/50 with the other two. In the end, for myself I'd dearly love it if the sspx chapel wasn't roughly 2 hours away but I have FSSP next to where I work or 20 mins away from my Dads house where I am every 2nd week to help him out. The NO just doesn't appeal to me at all from what little experience I've had with it, and the parishioners at my two local options aren't really my type of people.

It‚Äôs been an incredibly joyful period that has brought us closer as a family, and expanded our faith individually and as a family.  It‚Äôs a personal story that I‚Äôll engage in through DM if anyone is interested. The SSPX is not as big a deal in the big picture as they claim to be. Bp Fellay had a great opportunity to bring them into communion in 2012 and for whatever reason he decided to keep the society out of the church.

Only then, decide what your position is, based on practicality and soundness of the position.

In particular, all reference to the nature of the Mass as a propitiatory sacrifice has been removed.The fact that the protestant observers ""had no authority"" is irrelevant, because they certainly gave their opinions, and the Novus Ordo mass is, by the admission of Annibale Bugnini himself, designed to appeal to protestants.Additionally, the Novus Ordo Mass does not conform to the requests of Sacrosanctum Concilium, and those requests could easily have been met with appropriate modifications to the traditional Mass without, for example, eliminating the entire offertory."

It is not only allowed -- it is actually necessary -- to resist the source of such destruction, and to preserve the traditional Catholic faith and practice until such time as it is restored to its rightful place throughout the Catholic Church.And there is no doubt that this will happen.

The SSPX often have lunches after Mass so there's a good likelihood you can approach an SSPX priest in a relaxed environment without it being too formal or nerve wracking.The SSPX, as all other orders do, have programmes for welcoming new converts into the Church. They run catechism lessons and undertake the formation of new catechumens. You could always ask your local SSPX priests if they'd allow you to sit in on some of these classes.

I've done so on numerous occasions, and I would gladly and happily do so again if I were to come into contact with any other such texts in the future.This is what His Holiness Pope Saint Pius X taught on the topic of protestant mistranslations of the Holy Bible and what should be done with them:>32*Q.*What should a Christian do who has been given a Bible by a Protestant or by an agent of the Protestants?  *A.*A Christian to whom a Bible has been offered by a Protestant or an agent of the Protestants should reject it with disgust, because it is forbidden by the Church. If it was accepted by inadvertence, **it must be burnt as soon as possible or handed in to the Parish Priest**.>33*Q.*Why does the Church forbid Protestant Bibles?  *A.*The Church forbids Protestant Bibles because, either they have been altered and contain errors, or not having her approbation and footnotes explaining the obscure meanings, they may be harmful to the Faith. It is for that same reason that the Church even forbids translations of the Holy Scriptures already approved by her which have been reprinted without the footnotes approved by her.[The quote is from the section ""On Holy Scripture"" in the Catechism of Pope Saint Pius X from 1910 A.D.](https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/catechism-of-st-pius-x-1286)Don't be surprised if you see naysayers crop up in the comments section of this post and not only dare to disagree with His Holiness Pope Saint Pius X's teaching on this matter but even go so far as to say that it's alright to read these vile texts. I've seen such clowns numerous times on this very subreddit. Never, ever forget that like all subreddits this place has open borders and that literally anyone can post here.His Holiness Pope Leo X taught in his [Papal Bull *Exsurge Domine* in 1520 A.D. condemning the errors of protestantism](https://www.papalencyclicals.net/leo10/l10exdom.htm) that the faithful are to regard as condemned, reprobated and rejected these errors and that all Catholics are restrained in the virtue of holy obedience under the penalty of automatic major excommunication. His Holiness Pope Leo X forbid every one of the faithful, in virtue of holy obedience and under the aforementioned penalty of major excommunication to be incurred automatically, to ""read, assert, preach, praise, print, publish, or defend"" these texts. That includes protestant mistranslations of the Holy Bible.So, to all you naysayers, enjoy your automatic major excommunication while you read the filth in the king james mistranslation and fanfiction of the Holy Bible. The rest of us will continue to read the Douay-Rheims and other actually Catholic translations of the Latin Vulgate, and we will also continue to reject your vapid suggestions that we join you in polluting our minds and souls by exposing ourselves such vile filth as you seem to do on a regular basis.

You can't hold any standards when you are a relativist. You can't be happy as a hedonist.Religion is the only way to be happy and to live a life that is internally congruent. Happiness is most strongly correlated with the virtue of love, so that lead me to ""Christianity"". I ruled out protestantism immediately, because it has no internal consistency. Every single protestant believes something different, practices their own way, and rarely improves. It's like a glass pane smashed to pieces. Everything is there, but it is disordered, confused, and broken. Protestantism is ultimately a modernist ideology, because it is relativistic.So I turned to Catholicism. It celebrated love in a way that no other religion does. Everything that I learned was congruent. It fit together like puzzle pieces in a way that was pleasing and confounding. Some of the teachings confused me, but my lack of understanding didn't indicate that Catholicism was confused. As I continued to learn Catholicism quickly replaced any contending beliefs.When I attended the Novus Ordo I made several friends who were a bit younger than me. They kept complaining about the SSPX and how traditional they were ‚Äìtradition being the antithesis of modernism. I knew that I needed to go there when my friends proclaimed the desire for women to be priests. My friends were confused.The next week I attended the SSPX."
1jlomv3,Leaving the Novus Ordo,mk5hfcm,Duibhlinn,8,"Well the first step would be to attend the Latin Mass, have you done that yet? There's little point in reading books etc. on something that will be entirely hypothetical and intellectual to you if you haven't actually experienced and witnessed what they are talking about at least a few times.I was raised nominally Novus Ordo but followed a similar trajectory in that I first merely preferred the Latin Mass and then stopped attending the Novus Ordo entirely. My stopping going to the new Mass had nothing to do with the SSPX really, and it isn't ""the SSPX position"" as you call it. Most traditionalists de facto exclusively attend the Latin Mass when given a choice. My attitude towards the Novus Ordo changed when I began attending a diocesan Latin Mass regularly. If a child is raised exclusively on highly processed frozen food their entire life and then later on is able to regularly eat real, homemade food for the first time they aren't going to want to willingly go back to the slop. It was a pretty obvious and self evident natural conclusion to me: if given the choice, why would I willingly go back to the novus ordo when the Latin Mass is superior by every metric? Why have a hamburger when you can have steak?I was largely unfamiliar with the nuts and bolts of the liturgy at the time, I was simply looking at what was plainly before my eyes. I have more substantial reasons for my attitude now but it began by just looking at what was in front of me.>So if you‚Äôre someone that left the NO for the TLM exclusively I‚Äôd love to hear how long it took you to assent to the SSPX position, as I don‚Äôt want to be overly cautious or reckless in the decision to leave or not leave the new mass.People attending the Latin Mass don't have to sign a contract at the front doors saying they will never attend the Novus Ordo again. Just go yourself and experience it. There really is no substitute for just going and seeing it yourself. Ultimately most people, the longer they attend the Latin Mass and are exposed to the traditional liturgy, end up naturally, in and of themselves, desiring to stop attending the novus ordo. It's not something we do to gain acceptance into some sort of trad club, it's a natural consequence of repeated exposure to a Mass that is superior to the novus ordo in every regard.>I have a wonderful parish communityI understand why you're bringing this up but it that's completely besides the point. You aren't going to Mass, well at least you shouldn't be going to Mass, for the community. That's what protestants do in their made up fake religion. All the ancient pagans who converted to Catholicism did so despite suffering greatly socially, and they did it because it was true. It's as simple as that. We aren't Catholics for a social life, perhaps your diocesan seminary might not be communicating that to you but it's simply not what Catholicism is. A healthy community is a natural byproduct of people who are adhering to the truth who have gathered together but it's not the goal. Traditionalists who are going to the Latin Mass are doing so because they are interested in religious truth and they believe that's where they'll find it. They certainly aren't going out of their way to attend the TLM because they think it'll be good for their social lives.Ultimately if you want to be a priest you need a more serious attitude. The primary purpose of a parish is to provide the Sacraments, not to be a social club. You're there to get the Sacraments and to receive religious truth, anything else is just a bonus. If priests spent a little less time pretending they're social workers and a little more time doing their jobs as priests the Church wouldn't be in as terrible a state as it is today.The question of Latin Mass or Novus Ordo is ultimately about truth, not about how many friends you're going to make. If all we cared about was community none of our ancestors would have converted from paganism. I completely understand that what you said about community is only one part of your post but I in complete sincerity say to you that it's important to examine your emotional motivations when appraising the situation before you. We are all humans who can be easily swayed by our attachments to the things of this world, but ultimately the call of the Christian is to attempt to look beyond those worldly pushes and pulls and to try and seek the truth. If the question of ""what is the community like"" is even entering your mind when considering the question of whether you should attend the Latin Mass or the novus ordo then I sincerely say to you that you most probably need to take time to consciously reexamine your calculus and the motivations influencing your thought process."
1jlomv3,Leaving the Novus Ordo,mk5g1bg,Intrepid-Today-4825,4,I left the NO; our first three children were baptised in a NO church. I got a bit of friendly criticism from both sides
1jlomv3,Leaving the Novus Ordo,mk7rkty,None,5,"I am lucky enough to be born in the SSPX, so I don't correspond to your criteria, but I'll pray for you! And if you have any question for someone born in it instead of someone who came from the NO, let me know!"
1jlomv3,Leaving the Novus Ordo,mk5eq4p,PleasantStorm4241,3,"I left the Novus Ordo about five years ago...Mostly. I live far from the closest SSPX chapel and drive alone, so I attend twice a month, more at times. Not attending Mass on those weekends when I didn't drive to the SSPX chapel had ALWAYS gnawed at me in those first few years when it was the TLM offered by the SSPX or nothing. If the NO Masses are valid (albeit problematic), and the Host is truly consecrated, becoming the Body of Christ, I can't not be there. (Unless the Masses offered locally were worse than they are.) Plus I do get to hear Scripture and the Gospel. My local NO parishes have the usual problems: Immodest and/or sloppy dress, Eucharistic ministers, Communion in the hand, awful modern music, women handling the ciborium and opening/closing the tabernacle, female lectors, and so on. It's depressing and makes me appreciate the TLM and SSPX more.Some circumstances have cut down drastically on my ability to travel to the SSPX chapel so I've been attending a local parish since last year. However, the parish I attend (populated by some other ""refugees,"" as I call them, from our former parish run by a couple of priests who are likely a couple) is dying. Two of three Masses are maybe 1/4 full, the largest maybe 1/3 full. It has a lot of debt, too. I give it two years before it's closed. Ironically, so I heard, that before Traditiones Custodes, this parish was going to get one TLM. It has the three steps to the altar, and the lack of an altar rail could easily be remedied by a few kneelers. If it had the TLM, I'd instead give it two years to flourish.Anyway, I know my SSPX friends would be horrified that I attend an NO. I'd also tell them that if they were so bothered by it they could come pick me up drive me there and back. I doubt I've have takers. God willing, there will come a day when I live close to an SSPX chapel and I can be done with the NO."
1jlomv3,Leaving the Novus Ordo,mkaiugs,None,1,"I left the new rite but didn't left the church, personally I go to divine liturgy(Catholic Melkite rite) and also the society masses, and some times a diocesan mass that does the Old Latin Rite. I might be a minority some people are purist of the Latin Church, but I think is important to be in communion has much as possible so I frequent Divine Liturgy.Also The Society is not the magisterium so you don't have to agree a 100% with them to attend."
1jlomv3,Leaving the Novus Ordo,mkc4ws3,Cathain78,1,"I left our NO parish 1.5 years ago and stopped our children attending Mass at our parish church with the school. It wasn‚Äôt easy, it caused arguments with some family, but it was absolutely worth it. The first time we attended High Mass at the SSPX chapel we were amazed and knew immediately we had found our way back home. I would say that anyone interested in attending the SSPX has been given and incredible grace. And yes, it does often involved us picking up our cross and enduring some hardship to follow Christ, but my family‚Äôs spiritual life has blossomed. Instead of being bored at NO Mass, my young son came out of his first TLM and declared his desire to be an altar server, which now he is. He made is First Confession and First Communion at the Society and my daughter will do the same.As others have said, once you start attending you will find it increasingly difficult to go back. The scales will fall from your eyes and your conscience will make it very difficult to attend a NO again. When you do, it becomes a penance in itself."
1jlomv3,Leaving the Novus Ordo,mk5hrt7,Duibhlinn,4,"I presume they were baptised before you left the NO. People could do with being more charitable in that regard, not everyone was raised in a traditional enclave and people simply aren't mind readers with perfect universal knowledge. I would have received my own confirmation for example in the traditional rite if I was able to but I didn't have perfect onmiscient knowledge as a literal child who had never even heard of a Latin Mass. If people are giving you guff for that they can safely be ignored."
1jlomv3,Leaving the Novus Ordo,mk5j1hf,Duibhlinn,5,"I'm not wading into the debate on whether one should attend the Novus Ordo or not, but I do want to address what you said about validity. I know you know this, but for the benefit of those reaidng, it's not that the SSPX or most trads think the Novus Ordo is invalid. It's not, when done according to the text.The SSPX view that Catholics should not attend the Novus Ordo derives from, and is in line with, what had always been traditionally believed about the obligation to attend Mass. When you essentially said, paraphrasing, that since it's valid and the Real Presence is truly there that you ""can't not be there"" is completely out of step with Catholic teaching. The Eastern Orthodox have valid Mass, would you also say that you ""can't not go"" to an Orthodox divine liturgy? The Arians had valid liturgy too, as did most schismatic groups in history. It's obviously not true that mere validity is enough to bind, or even enough to indicate you should attend. When many Greeks schismed from Rome there were also many who didn't, and the two groups used the same liturgy. Just because the Eastern Orthodox schismatic Greeks were using a good liturgy did not mean that it was okay to attend their Mass either.In actuality the traditional teaching on the Sunday obligation was rather lenient to the laity. Generally speaking the norm was that the laity were dispensed from their obligation in a few cases. Serious illness, very far travel distance etc. One of these cases was if attending said Mass presented spiritual danger, for example if the priest is a known heretic who denies dogma. Catholics living during the Arian heresy or the Nestorian controversy were not, for example, bound by Sunday obligation to attend an Arian or Nestorian Mass. The idea is ludicrous. Church law is ultimately, in its most basic principle, ordered for the good of your soul. It cannot bind you to do something which is bad for your soul.The actual debate among traditionalists is whether the Novus Ordo, in and of itself, when you completely set aside *how* it is said but only take into account what specifically the Novus Ordo is at its core, falls under that broad category. Some traditionalists think that if a Novus Ordo is celebrated with minimal liturgical abuse that it does not constitute something that is damaging or dangerous to the faith of those who attend and thus it does not dispense from the obligation. Other traditionalists, including the SSPX, believe that the Novus Ordo has intrinsic problems that are not effected by how it is said, but rather are part of its very DNA and that those problems do constitute danger and potential damage to the faith and souls of those who attend.What your opinion on the debate is is one thing, but it's important for everyone to be on the same page and for us to be clear about what the debate in question actually is. The SSPX isn't subjectively saying, based on the authority of their own opinions, that people shouldn't go because it's bad. What they are saying is based on the constant position of the Church from the very beginning, that Catholics are not bound to attend a Mass which presents a danger to their souls or is potentially damaging to their faith; their view, having studied the Novus Ordo extensively, is that such danger and potential damage is present within the DNA of the Novus Ordo, regardless of how it is said. That is why they give spiritual guidance on the matter to the effect that the Novus Ordo cannot bindingly obliate a person to attend it, given that in their view it is inherently dangerous and potentially damaging so it is incapable of exerting a binding obligation.>Anyway, I know my SSPX friends would be horrified that I attend an NO. I'd also tell them that if they were so bothered by it they could come pick me up drive me there and back. I doubt I've have takers.And have you tried asking? It sounds like you haven't."

(\*)Pope Benedict XVI claimed that option #1 is always the case when Vatican II seems to be at variance with traditional Catholic doctrine. The SSPX says that option #1 is often possible, but that certain statements of Vatican II cannot be reconciled with traditional Catholic doctrine, so that option #2 is the only possible way to explain those statements.(\*) This should not be interpreted as implying that a council can contradict previous Catholic doctrine by defining a new dogma.

One could argue ""Rome"" fell. The Pope at the time didn't join the heretics, but he was effective surrounded by them and made mostly ineffective in dealing with the Arian heresy, leaving St. Athanasius to restore as much of the Church as he could on the Pope's behalf.Our situation has differences.

Generally he supplies jurisdiction to local pastors who are your spiritual authority.

It is due to the Church‚Äòs nature as per the divine law, not any human legal obstacle. Therefore, there is no mechanism; the election simply holds no force. Practically speaking, a person who illegitimately intrudes upon the Holy See (i.e. has the appearance of occupying the office) must be deposed by a council of bishops, but this does not mean that such a person would have been Pope prior to the deposition. In fact, it is impossible since a true Pope can be judged by nobody; only an illegitimate intruder who is not the Pope could be deposed by the bishops.As to being condemned by Vatican I, I deny that. See the text I recently posted in which it is stated that Archbishop Purcell raised the question and was told that a heretical Pope would fall from office ipso facto."
1jj068k,Are sedevacantists catholic?,mjzxkz7,mineuserbane,0,"It is agreed in the case of formal heresy. It is not in the case of material heresy. This is a point of debate and has been for centuries (or longer). Your answer on mechanism does not suffice. >Therefore, there is no mechanism > must be deposed by a council of bishops Which is it? I think you are muddling several ideas. Perhaps because it would be too lengthy to write out here, but you're not making distinction between formal heresy and material heresy or a distinction between a loss of ability to define faith and morals and a loss of authority over the Church. These are the differences between sedevacantism and sedeprivationism. What argument are you making? That Francis is and was a formal heretic or material heretic? That he has lost all power of the Papacy and ceases to be Pope or just his ability to define faith and morals? Is a council of bishops required to depose him or not? Additionally, until the council of bishops does depose him, are we required to obey his leadership when he speaks from his position of authority? What happens if he is never deposed by a council of bishops? I am arguing about the premise, but the conclusion and practical effects of these arguments can clearly show that the premise must be false. I'd also challenge your appeal to authority. The only appeal that works in this case is the appeal to Church magisterial statements or Scriptural teachings. Neither have appeared in your comments yet. Purcell said it was answered, he does not say by whom. This did not end up in VI. Secondly, I believe he is referring to a formal heresy and alludes to a loss of his infallibility to define faith and morals, not the loss of his authority. Thirdly, this is a private opinion that has not been defined by the magisterium and is still subject to debate."
1jj068k,Are sedevacantists catholic?,mk0ogj1,MarcellusFaber,0,"1. Neither material nor formal heretics are members of the Church; it is an inaccurate usage to call mistaken Catholics material heretics. Material heretics properly speaking are the baptised, typically raised in heresy, to whom the divine origin of the Catholic Church has not been sufficiently proposed, such that they do not adhere to the Church as their rule of Faith, whilst formal heretics are pertinacious. It is hard to see how a Pope could not have had the divine origin of the Church sufficiently proposed to him, nor know that Luther was wrong about justification, for example, but, to head off the argument that the Modernism/bad philosophy of the post-Conciliar Popes prevents them from realising the contradiction between the traditional teaching & the new teaching, such people would also be incapable of adhering to the Church as their rule of Faith, and would be material heretics, and as such would not be members of the Church.2. The anti-Popes of history were not Popes, yet they were deposed, hence, as I said earlier, it is not required that a man be Pope to be deposed from the Holy See, only that he have the appearance of being Pope. Deposition in the case of a putative Pope is the formal recognition that he either never held the office or has fallen from office ipso facto, not the deprivation of the office itself.3. There can be no separation in the person of the Pope of his authority and his ability to define dogma. Since you are making this distinction, it falls on you to cite a source that supports it. Otherwise, it is gratuitously asserted, and therefore gratuitously denied.4. My position is that Francis is a formal heretic and therefore that he cannot be head of the Church, but if he were a material heretic due to his Modernism, that would make no difference.5. The deposition by a council of bishops would be required to elect a true Pope for practical reasons, but it would not cause the heretic to lose office, since he is prevented from holding office due to the Church‚Äôs nature as per her divine constitution.6. No, we are not bound to obey him or listen to him before the deposition since he would not be the Pope prior to the deposition.7. Your claim that only magisterial statements or scripture can be accepted as authorities is simply not how theology works, but I refer you to Mystici Corporis Christi, Satis Cognitum, and canon 188.4 of the 1917 code.8. Things can and are known with certainty without formal definition, for example the existence of guardian angels, or that Christ had a sense of humour.9. To state that this question is still subject to debate is to ignore the fact that all but a handful of theologians agree with what I am saying. If it is still subject to debate (which was explicitly contradicted by a German canonist in his Lehrbuch on Kirchenrechts), it must be accepted that your side has been losing and a minority for some centuries."

Personally, I very rarely do vigil NO Masses but if I do go to a TLM Vigil (like the Easter Vigil) or a TLM Mass where it takes place after 4 PM using the Sunday propers, I do count it towards the Sunday obligation.Edit: there was a place in my college town for a few months that had Saturday evening TLMs with the Sunday propers.

1jbzdgw,Anybody have a good prayer schedule they could offer me,mhygscn,Duibhlinn,2,"If you are just beginning then start small and build your way up from there. A good starting point is the Rosary, it includes many of the basic prayers such as the Our Father and Hail Mary. A good place to begin is saying a full set of mysteries once per day, and over the days and weeks you will gradually begin to learn and memorise the basic prayers through natural absorption and retention. Starting in your native language and then learning it in Latin is recommended.The Mass itself is one of the greatest prayers there is. The Missal is a good text for prayer. You can, in a sense, pray the Mass or pray the Missal. You naturally absorb it by exposure to Mass but it's fruitful to sit down and prayerfully read the text of the Mass, the ordinary first and foremost. More familiarity with the Mass will let you get more spiritual benefits out of attending Mass as well.J.R.R. Tolkien had the entire Mass memorised and on days where he was unable to attend daily Mass he would pray the entire Mass in Latin on his own.As a note, the *ordinary* of the Mass is a term that means those parts of the Mass that mostly the same every Mass such as the Pater Noster. The *propers* are the parts which change most Masses, like the Gospel and Epistle readings, the Collect prayer etc.The best advice I can give is to try not to overload yourself too fast. Prayer is like spiritual exercise. If you've never seriously exercised and you try to run for a mile you will be in bits, but if you slowly build up to it that same mile will eventually be far easier."

My sspx priest just recently told me that even my morning offering and rosary are more than most Catholics do, so don't be like me and feel guilty for not enough prayer.

They basically took the money, and the property, and ran. That's a complete lie and when I corrected you last time on this, you told me don't want to bother to read [the whole story](https://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/NineVLefebvre.pdf). Since you apparently cannot be bothered to read ""sedevacantist nonsense"" (aka a simple PDF), I've summarized your claims:## ""They were expelled for unrepentant sedevacantism.""**Fr. Cekada**: While some of the Nine already inclined to the sedevacantist position in 1983, others did not. Fr. Cekada explains (pp. 4‚Äì5) that many of the main disagreements with Archbishop Lefebvre at that time concerned:- Use of the 1962 (‚ÄòJohn XXIII‚Äô) Missal vs. older pre‚Äë1955 rubrics.- The acceptance of phony diocesan annulments that the Archbishop had begun to recognize in practice.- Toleration of doubtful priests ordained with the post‚ÄëVatican II form (e.g., Fr. Stark, who refused to be conditionally ordained).- The archbishop‚Äôs sudden switch to a more conciliatory stance toward the Vatican II establishment ( ‚Äúnegotiations‚Äù with Rome) and imposition of new ‚Äúparty lines.‚Äù**Fr. Cekada**: Archbishop Lefebvre had taken a much harder stance against Paul VI than he took against John Paul II. The archbishop had evidently softened after Paul VI died (1978), and by 1979‚Äì1981 was negotiating with the Vatican for an arrangement‚Äîsomething the older U.S. priests (the ‚Äúhardliners‚Äù) rejected.In early 1983, the Archbishop **threatened to expel priests even for not switching to the John XXIII Missal** (p. 6). The new demands caused major friction. The Nine‚Äôs March 25, 1983 letter to the Archbishop shows multiple doctrinal/liturgical reasons for the dispute.**Fr. Cekada**: A central cause of separation was the Archbishop‚Äôs willingness to bargain away important ‚Äútraditionalist‚Äù principles, such as unwavering rejection of the new sacraments, or unconditional refusal to accept the modernist annulment machinery. The priests believed ‚Äúloyalty to the Church‚Äù (and her perennial Tradition) outranked ‚Äúloyalty to the Society‚Äù or one prelate‚Äôs changing stance. Multiple issues were in play, many having nothing to do with whether any priest privately held the Holy See to be vacant. Indeed, by the time of the April 1983 ‚Äúshowdown,‚Äù not all Nine were yet fully sedevacantist.## ""They stole money and property, basically took everything and ran.""**Fr. Cekada on ""Who contributed the funds?""**: The chapels in dispute were (with one or two exceptions, e.g., Ridgefield Seminary) paid for by local faithful, not the SSPX‚Äôs European headquarters.- Page 2: ""With the exception of the seminary building in Ridgefield CT, the local congregations that we served contributed all the funds for the purchase and operation of these facilities. The overwhelming majority of lay members in each place supported our stand.""- **Lawsuits originated from Archbishop Lefebvre, not from the Nine:** The archbishop demanded that all these local non‚Äëprofit chapel corporations be signed over to him (pp. 7‚Äì8). The Nine, whose names and local directors were on those civil corporations, refused, so the Archbishop sued‚Äînot the other way around. ‚ÄúHe sued, we sued back,‚Äù Fr. Cekada says (p. 2).Thus, the idea that the Nine ‚Äúran off with property‚Äù ignores the fact that **the Archbishop was the one who first went to the civil courts to take local chapels away from them**. After four years of complicated legal battles across multiple states, they settled. Some chapels ended up with the Archbishop/SSPX. Others remained with the priests and faithful who opposed the Archbishop. An actual payment was made to the Archbishop/SSPX: they accepted $350,000 (later effectively $205,000 after the new mortgages). This was a ‚Äúbuy‚Äëout‚Äù arrangement so that property disputes would cease.Both parties signed a legal release settling all claims. The PDF states, ‚ÄúOnce SSPX did so and actually accepted money from us, the principles of Catholic moral theology on 'condonation' require that SSPX and its supporters **forever refrain from claiming that the Nine 'stole' property from them.** For the discounted price of $205,000, we bought ‚Äòem out, fair and square.‚Äù (p. 13).Summary:- No court found ‚Äúfinancial fraud‚Äù by the Nine.- Both sides ended with certain properties.- The faithful at those chapels, by large majority, wanted the Nine to remain and did not regard them as thieves.- The final settlement involved money going to the Archbishop‚Äôs side.## ""They pocketed leftover money that didn‚Äôt belong to them.""The parishes in question customarily formed lay, non‚Äëprofit corporations in America. The original purchase cost of these chapels was generally raised from local faithful, under local boards; this was standard among independent Traditional Catholic missions in the 1970s‚Äì80s, particularly to prevent a future ‚Äúsell‚Äëout‚Äù to the diocesan establishment.- No direct evidence in any lawsuit proved that the Nine were using parish money for personal gain. - The Archbishop‚Äôs side alleged that the Nine were ‚Äútrustees‚Äù or ‚Äúagents‚Äù who held property on behalf of the SSPX, but: They never obtained an official ruling supporting the notion that the Nine personally ‚Äúpocketed‚Äù sums.In fact, the judge eventually pushed the parties to settle, seeing that **the corporations and property were predominantly funded and deeded by local people, not by the European Society**.Conclusion: There is **nothing** in the lawsuits or in the PDF to substantiate that the Nine ‚Äúpocketed‚Äù leftover funds or spent them on themselves. On the contrary, the final buy‚Äëout indicates that money flowed the other way: **the Nine‚Äôs corporations paid the Archbishop/SSPX to finalize settlement**.## ‚ÄúThey refused to repent of sedevacantism.‚Äù Sedevacantism was not the only doctrinal disagreement. The 25‚ÄëMarch‚Äë1983 letter from the Nine to Archbishop Lefebvre had six major points about practice and doctrine. ‚ÄúRefusing to name John Paul II in the Canon‚Äù was just one dimension that had appeared much earlier (p. 3). Far more immediate in 1983 were:- The acceptance of phony annulments,- Use of John XXIII rites aka 1962 Missal (as opposed to the pre-1955 one)- Sanctioning priests ordained in doubtfully valid rites, etc.- Many of the Nine did gradually adopt a sedevacantist conclusion, not all were sedevacantist- Archbishop Lefebvre‚Äôs own wavering, trying to be a diplomat to ""get a deal"" with modernistSome (e.g., Fr. Jenkins, Fr. Collins) moved to that position later; some (Fr. Kelly) was reticent earlier; some (Fr. Cekada, Fr. Sanborn, Fr. Dolan) leaned strongly that way earlier.The friction with Archbishop Lefebvre also hinged on the contradiction of the post‚ÄëVatican II popes making or permitting ‚Äúmanifestly heretical‚Äù changes to the Sacraments.**Fr. Cekada**: In the 1970s, the Archbishop himself said things that logically hinted at vacancy of the Papal See. He would disclaim officially that it was his position but simultaneously allow that ‚ÄúOne can say the Pope is not the Pope‚Äù (p. 3, quoting the Archbishop‚Äôs remarks). So the question was never so clear‚Äëcut as ‚Äúthey are purely unrepentant rebels.‚ÄùThe break did not boil down to ‚Äúsedevacantism or no.‚Äù Some among the Nine ended as open sedevacantists after leaving, but the break originally had multiple causes. The PDF does not support that they were simply ‚Äúexpelled for unrepentant sedevacantism.‚Äù---Also: **Calling other Catholics ""cockroaches"" for having doubts really exposes your own nature.** Note: I'm not sedevacantist myself, I'm with the Resistance, I even pray for Pope Francis - but I'm not going around calling other people ""cockroaches"" or lying. Please repent from your pride, especially in this time of Lent."

There are some Catholic books of academic commentary on the Bible but most are from after the council. The Jerome Biblical Commentary is the most authoritative - **but** it is historical-critical which Leo XIII condemned in *Providentissimus Deus* but was liberated by Pius XII in *Divino Afflante Spiritu*. The 1968 edition is probably the least overtly modernist. It still has issues.What is the historical-critical method? It is a form of textual criticism that appraises the world behind the text - in effect, what were the circumstances that led to certain word choices.It's up to you really. But bear in mind that prior to the council there basically was no Catholic biblical criticism and any group that was concerned with it before the council ended up embroiled in modernism. The traditional Catholic way of approaching scripture is to read it in a prayerful way and listen to it and see how it works within the tradition of the faith as handed down, allowing God to speak to you through the words. The Catholic way of viewing things is that scripture and tradition must walk together to bring forth fruits."

But bear in mind that prior to the council there basically was no Catholic biblical criticism and any group that was concerned with it before the council ended up embroiled in modernism.Well, Bible study isn't really ""criticism"" as Catholics understand it - as a former Protestant, it's more like talking about certain passages, usually with someone more experienced highlighting parallels / cross-references, commentary, talking about common misconceptions, playing ""Devils advocate"", taking different positions, etc. Despite obviously twisting Scripture with error, it's ironically one of the few things Protestants are actually good at (the other one being organizing / networking). Catholics are more like ""I have to ask a priest for everything"", okay but priests are few and far in between and busy. Even Jesus was lecturing in the temple about scripture and knew it well to refute the Jews who tempted him.Bible study is basically training in apologetics as you go along, not criticizing. If you don't train, you can't fight. Our priest occasionally does a ""catechism for adults"", but that's not exactly the same."

You would not be committing a mortal sin by following the directives of your parish priest, no matter if he is Novus Ordo. The priest has a duty to ensure that true consent is being given and that the parents and godparents truly desire to raise the child in the Faith, that is the purpose of the classes. Infant baptism is only tenable if the people speaking on behalf of the child truly intend to raise the child in the Faith (not because it‚Äôs family/cultural custom to baptize, the parents are afraid of the child going to hell, etc).If your child is in danger of death then anyone can baptize, otherwise you need to have a priest baptize the child (it would actually be a mortal sin for you to baptize without the need to, and there is no penalty for delaying infant baptism at the direction of your priest).The Novus Ordo has lately been using delays to ascertain how serious someone is about practicing their Faith (eg long baptism prep courses, long marriage prep courses). Lots of people get on religious kicks and for a few weeks are super gung ho about everything, but then they run out of gas and go back to their normal, worldly ways. A priest administering a sacrament in this day and age needs to ascertain that that is not the case, that someone has a deep and sustainable desire to the practice the Faith. If you‚Äôre willing to wait a few months to receive a sacrament and follow through the requisite classes, then you probably aren‚Äôt going to be a flake.The SSPX doesn‚Äôt really have an established way of doing the same ascertaining, so it‚Äôs down to the individual priest. SSPX priests, for better or worse, will typically just have a conversation with you to figure out how serious you are about the sacrament in question and then make a decision there, not make you wait months.It‚Äôs certainly a faster way to get things done, but you should definitely keep in mind the fact that you and the godparents will be held responsible before God on Judgement Day if the child does not follow through with the promises made at baptism."

I would suggest reading or listening to his book ""An Open Letter to Confused Catholics"". It covers the questions you are asking and the position of the SSPX. It is available for free on YouTube as a six and a half hour video. (I would link it, but some subreddits don't do well with links.)Our priests have advised us that it does fulfill our Sunday obligations, but that it is probably better not to attend."

Go for it, you'll encounter obstacles but you won't regret it!Vatican 2: the SSPX considers this Council as containing claims contradicting Tradition on 3 issues: ecumenism, religious freedom, and counciliarism. I can give more detail if you wanna, but you can find everything by just googling one of those words and ""SSPX"".Regarding the NO, the SSPX uses the brief critical exam of the new mass as their main summary of their position (you can find it online on the Angelus Press site it's short and informative). Basically, it considers the NO Mass as going away from the traditional vision of Mass, and therefore thinks that we should back to the TLM in the entire Church. That doesn't make all the people who go to it without knowing how dangerous it has been bad people of course, that's an important point to keep in mind.As an ex NO goer you'll certainly not feel alone, many people are among SSPX parishioners, and the rest love to see people who were brave enough to make that journey. There'll always be close minded judgmental people, but don't waste your time caring about what they say!"
1iwqm14,I'm a wanabee Traditionalist and have some questions regarding the SSPX,menq773,Jumpy_Cardiologist61,5,"The SSPX recognizes Vatican II as a valid ecumenical council. It thinks some parts are fine, other parts are ambiguous, and other parts cannot be squared with traditional Catholic doctrine.Since it is a pastoral council and not a dogmatic one, and therefore not infallible, the SSPX rejects the parts that are contrary to traditional Catholic doctrine. Specifically, religious liberty, ecumenism, and collegiality.The SSPX thinks the Novus Ordo has been altered to make it more man-centered, liberal and ecumenical. It thinks that certain essential parts of Catholic teaching have been systematically obscured or downplayed, like the sacrificial nature of the Mass. It recommends that people not attend the Novus Ordo because it can gradually undermine your faith.Speaking as someone that used to go to the Novus Ordo, just expect for there to be a learning curve with the Latin Mass. It will take a few times to get a feel for things. Just soak it in and don't worry too much about following along. I recommend going to a High Mass if you're able to so you get the full experience.The people will be very pious and politically conservative. Men and women will be dressed formally and modestly. Women will be wearing chapel veils. It will be very reverent.I would recommend the SSPX podcast series on the crisis in the Church. It's very good. They have episodes on all of these topics.

And also the reform that came from Vatican II, the Novus Ordo and its modernist and protestant character.- I believe the Society teaches that the NO does fill Sunday obligation. (I could be wrong)I came from the Novus Ordo too, and I know the chance is drastic, especially in Latin American countries where the NO has no reverence. Expect beauty and something totally different, I encourage you to study the rubrics and for your first Mass don‚Äôt try to follow it, just take it all in.

1ipvwzw,A Serious Inquiry...,mcvet6g,None,9,"Hi!Regarding salvation outside of the Church, it's theoretically possible for someone with ""invincible ignorance"" of the Catholic faith (meaning someone who has no possibility to know the Catholic faith) to be saved; but he won't be saved by his false religion, he'd still be saved by Christ's sacrifice and therefore by the Catholic Church, even if he doesn't know it.That person would need to live in accordance with natural law, to not have committed mortal sins, and more importantly, to receive a special grace from God.Non traditionalists usually don't believe in the dogma of ""No salvation outside of the Church"", which is why they often aren't able to find a precise position on that issue.Congrats for your path of conversion, and make sure to talk to an SSPX priest about that issue, you'll get all the answers you need! Sadly we live in a time of Church crisis, so we have to picky who we consider a reliable source for Catholic faith."
1ipvwzw,A Serious Inquiry...,mcva6iz,WallachianLand,5,"He dodged the question because Vatican II teaches ""ecumenism"", all non-traditional Catholics can't answer this question without bringing the problem of the ""Vatican II Council"" which brings this and more troubles to the table.First, there's no salvation outside the Church, what can happen is perhaps a person could reach God in his last moments of life and convert, and that's pretty much it, that saidYou shouldn't put your faith in people, since they're most likely, disappoint you as you already can see for yourself that you are, the catechism of Baltimore is correct and therefore it doesn't matter what a lay person or a ""priest"" says otherwise.Also, to be sure about the righteousness of someone's take, is to simply study about the doctrine and the magisterium, if the magisterium and the doctrines says something, then it's true, I recommend seeing everything before the 60s, because of the Vatican II Council, which is a touchy subject"
1ipvwzw,A Serious Inquiry...,md20pgz,asimovsdog,3,"> I appreciated those quotes and asked him why would Our Mother Church make moves towards ecumenism. Well, it wasn't Mother Church, it was infiltrating freemasons. They did plan it for more than 150 years, starting in 1717 with the French Revolution (against Catholics), infiltrating universities in the 1800s, launching Communism in 1917, liberation theology, etc. Which is IMO an argument for Catholicism, because why would judeo-masons conspire to infiltrate Catholics specifically instead of Orthodox, Anglicans, etc.A couple days ago, I was interested in what arguments Orthodox have against Catholics and I discovered [this site](https://www.trueorthodoxy.org/polemics/heretics_roman_catholics.shtml) from the ""Genuine Orthodox Church of America"", which lists ecumenism as ""a heresy stemming from the 20th-century Freemasonic takeover of the Vatican"". It's ironic that Orthodox heretics are more honest than even some Catholics. Currently, there is a war between ""Catholic Authority"" (the people in the Church buildings) and ""Catholic Faith"" (the people outside of the buildings, but preaching the Catholic doctrine). To what percentage both are united, nobody knows. Sedevactantists say its 100% - 0%, Resistance / SSPX varies between 99% - 1% and maybe 80% Authority - 20% Faith (i.e. praying for the pope, but otherwise ignoring what he says until he comes back to his senses).Your friend - as I presume most diocesan-taught people - is indoctrinated to think that people outside of the Church building (i.e. the diocese, in submission to a modernistic bishop, in submission to a modernist-influenced pope), cannot be saved, which is wrong. In the end, the Faith is far more important than the pope. He avoided the question, but that doesn't invalidate Catholicism, it just means we're going through a very rough phase, in which ""cultural Catholicism"" is purged (good!).> Why would our Lord reach out to all the sinners and bring good news?He reaches out to people, but he can't force anyone. He wants a heaven full of people, not robots. People are either going to accept or not. We must pray for them and try to be just, because the prayer of a just man is worth much more than the prayer of an unjust man. A lot of people certainly feel that there is something wrong with the modern world, but very few investigate. Very few dig deep down on what the issue actually is (people glorifying freedom, instead of using their reason to submit to Gods will). I've talked with a lot of people who came pretty close and then totally rejected some dogma (i.e. I had a Protestant that was close to converting multiple times, even prayed to Mary, and then turned around and said Catholics worship cookies, I just... anyway). They will go to hell (not a deep hell, but certainly not heaven), because they did not seek God with ""all their strength"". God cannot condemn anyone who tries his/her best to get to heaven. He can save people despite of their religion, even Protestants despite their error (not because of it). But many people fall into distractions, give up searching, distract themselves, etc. That doesn't mean it's okay for them to go on being Protestants.> I do not want to give up on Catholicism, and with all due respect to my friend, his comment was discouraging...We are attached to the eternal Rome, not the temporal, infiltrated Vatican. Right now the pope is a Jesuit, likely immolated from a slew of yes-men and corrupt clergy since childhood. We say that ""yes, he's the pope, but his mind is basically a slush of ecumenism, modernism, trying-to-be-nice-ism"". When a good, strong pope cleans up the heresies of Vatican II, I'll be the first to hail the pope. I don't reject the papacy, but the ""submission to the Roman pontiff"" does not mean that we have to follow a weak pope into ecumenist error.> we just watch some videos, and no discussion ever occursI wouldn't count that as ""good"" if no discussion is happening. Anyway. Read the [1910 Catholic Encyclopedia](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/), it's very solid. The Baltimore Catechism isn't bad, but you might not get all the context from your diocesan priest watching YT videos, as most non-traditional priests today are poorly formed.Pray the rosary every day, get into practicing prayer, [Divinum Officium](https://www.divinumofficium.com/), [LOBVM](https://www.lobvm.com/), Jesus Prayer, etc. You can go to heaven even without the Mass (certainly useful if you have it), but not without prayer. Research apologetics and ignore any advice that encourages you in complacency."

1ipvwzw,A Serious Inquiry...,mdt2zol,Jumpy_Cardiologist61,1,"I recommend the book ""Deadly Indifference: How the Church Lost Her Mission, and How We Can Reclaim It"" by Eric Sammons.

""Outside the Church there is no salvation"" is Church dogma. The Church is the Ark of salvation, and everyone else is outside in the Flood: Protestants, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, atheists, etc.It is theoretically possible for non-Catholics to be saved if they have ""invincible ignorance"", where they aren't culpable for their lack of belief. This is rare and not something to count on: the analogy that the Baltimore Catechism uses is a few people clinging on to the outside of the Ark with ropes. We are called to bring everyone we can into the Ark and save their souls.Since Vatican II, Church leaders have basically sold this dogma down the river because they think it's outdated, narrow-minded, and mean. Instead, they promote ecumenism, where basically you say that other religions are praiseworthy, that people can be saved without becoming Catholic, and you just endlessly dialogue with them instead of trying to convert them.This has dramatically undermined both evangelization (if you don't need to become Catholic to be saved, why go through all the hassle?) and Catholics' own attachment to their faith (if being Catholic isn't essential for salvation, why does it matter if I don't practice my faith or switch to a different religion?).Your friend can't give you a straight answer because he would have to say that most modern Church leaders are wrong and are undermining a dogma of the Church, which he doesn't want to do.As for advice, I'd recommend going to the closest Latin Mass.

Romanian and Ukrainian ones can often be quite ethnic, but not all are; I go to a very non-ethnic Romanian mission (though I am canonically Romanian Greek Catholic).I can't speak as much for other Eastern Catholic Churches, but I would say that the Maronites are heavily latinized/modernized (though some of that is going back to tradition), and the Chaldeans and Syro-Malabars are somewhat that way too. The Armenian Church is one I haven't personally visited but I've been to an Armenian Orthodox liturgy and it is beautiful, so the Armenian Catholic one probably is, too.From the SSPX perspective, the Eastern Churches didn't have a liturgical reform in the way the Latins did in the 1960s-1970s, so I would imagine Eastern parishes would at least in some ways be more ""acceptable."""

Robinson and the neo-SSPX don't want to preach the position of its founder anymore or put this quote on their website (so stop asking me to cite from the neo-SSPX website please), that's their choice. I stick to what Lefevbre said one year before his death, because it makes sense.> I would argue that hearing mass is not the same as supporting the priest or the group that the priest representsOn a personal-conscience level, the priest might not agree to Vatican II, but an FSSP priest at least formally signs that he is perfectly okay with material heresy. Add onto that the doubt about ordinations in the New Rite, bi-ritualism in the FSSP, etc. And if you take ""communion"" from such a priest (while knowing that he is okay with heresy), what does that make you in your Last Judgement?The case with the Resistance members going to SSPX Masses is a bit of a false equivalent, because the SSPX has at least formally not signed off on heresy yet. The Resistance argument is that the SSPX is ""drifting"" in that direction and is therefore equal in ""shaking hands with Modernists"" to the FSSP already. Some Resistance priests like Fr. Hewko, also advise to avoid the SSPX Masses, for that exact reason. But in difference to the FSSP there is not a ""clear-as-day"" indication as there is with the ""full communion"" aka Ecclesia Dei communities (all ""full communion"" communities have to SIGN IN WRITING that they fully accept Vatican II). With the neo-SSPX there is always plausible deniability as the change was more subtle.I personally support Fr. Hewko in his opinion, because over the course of the last year the shift at my local parish got very obvious (my priest is a complete liberal, I can't trust him with my soul), but it's not as clear everywhere that ""the SSPX is lost"". Formally, the SSPX will certainly tell you otherwise, that they're still fighting. The FSSP will not tell you that, as they are ""in communion"" with modernist Rome and not fighting anything."

The doubt already is the fact that it ""can be invalid or not"". This doubt comes from the fact that we cannot look into the bishops heart, which is why even Novus Ordo ordained priests themselves ask to be re-consecrated, despite the fact that they might already be validly consecrated priests. There is ""doubt"" due to the rite, because with the new rite we cannot to 100% certainty know what the bishop intented, did he intend to create a priest or a preacher? That is what the word ""doubtful"" means.Also, try and tell the lay faithful that they need to check every single priest, every single bishop, etc. In the old rite there was no doubt, in the new rite there is doubt. The SSPX used to require conditional re-ordination (at least up until their sellout in 2012 AFAIK)."

1igj02k,"Tridentine Mass vs Novus Ordo...Which one is considered to be more ""authentic""?",mapewaa,No-Test6158,13,"Even though he was a sede, Fr Anthony Cekada's book *""Work of Human Hands""* is considered an excellent resource on this matter.There are elements of the Novus Ordo that are from the traditions of the church - the inclusion of the ""Bidding prayers"" for example, is something that would have been fairly normal in the pre-counter reformation church. But it's more a matter of what the New Mass removes that is of concern than what the New Mass has.Elements like the Offertory were radically altered to *de-emphasise* (because Bugnini knew that he couldn't outright deny) the sacrificial quality of the Mass. The prayers at the foot of the altar and the introit were removed entirely, the collects were changed to de-emphasise things that were *""too Catholic""*. The Offertory verse was suppressed outright. The Offertory was changed to remove references to transubstantiation and the sacrificial quality. The prayer to the Holy Trinity over the gifts was removed. The Canon was outright vandalised. The Canon is the oldest and singularly untouched part of the Mass. It was common to all expressions of the Roman Rite. It has its origins in the very words of St Peter. To reform it to be 4 ""Eucharistic Prayers"" really does damage the sacredness of this point of the Mass. This is a clear departure from the ancient practices of the church. The communion verse was re-branded as the ""communion song"" and the post-communion became almost part of the dismissal.In terms of ceremonial, the new missal is a stark departure from what went before. The most striking is the shift from Ad Orientem to Versus Populum. Yes, the New Mass can be said, in Latin, Ad Orientem but that doesn't make it any better. Vestments like the maniple, the cincture and the amice were suppressed. Even really small things like the stole were reformed. In the pre-62 rites, a priest crossed his stole. Only a bishop was entitled to wear it straight down. The number of signs of the cross were radically reduced. The priest makes the sign of the cross 52 times in the 62 Missal. He makes it far fewer times in the 1970 reformed missal. The Gloria Patri isn't present in the new mass so there is no reverence at this point. The priest makes no bows at any of the Holy Names. The ringing of bells only occurs at the epiklesis and the elevation. The second Confiteor is suppressed. The Kyrie is now a back and forth and not a 3 fold reflection of church teaching. The priest and the people confess together (misereatur nostri vs. vestri/tui in the old Mass). The Domine Non Sum is only recited once. And the priest no longer strikes his breast at the Agnus, the Nobis Quoque or the Domine Non Sum.It is also a false flag to declare the Missal of Pius V as a *""creation""* of the counter reformation. All Pius V did was formally codify the Roman Rite to ensure more unity in the church. But if one attended a Sarum Use Mass or a Dominican Use or even an Ambrosian, one would find they would all be strikingly similar - because they share a common origin. Pius V declared in Quo Primum that any liturgy with an origin of greater than 200 years prior to the Council of Trent could continue. He was actively suppressing the new forms of ""Mass"" that were emerging during the reformation that denied key Catholic teachings.So, no, the new-mass is not a return to ancient liturgical customs. It is an entirely new creation entirely. It apes the traditional mass, but it cannot be considered a worthy change or anything to be proud of. It is valid, but validity is not the mark of quality. The position of the SSPX is that it is valid, but spiritually and intellectually deficient and that it poses a grave risk to the faith. I'd like to think that these fruits are coming forth and the SSPX are being thoroughly vindicated. Especially with research suggested 4/5s of Catholics do not believe in transubstantiation.In terms of reading, alongside Cekada's aforementioned work, I'd also recommend Fr Adrian Fortescue's *""The Mass: A Study of the Roman Liturgy""* which gives a stirling overview of the development of the Roman Mass over the centuries."

1igj02k,"Tridentine Mass vs Novus Ordo...Which one is considered to be more ""authentic""?",maqbde1,Willsxyz,8,"I will add to this excellent response the fact that the Second Vatican Council did NOT ask for the novus ordo Mass. It's quite easy to take the 1962 missal, apply the changes asked for in Sacrosanctum Concilium and see what you get -- it isn't the novus ordo.Also, your friend ""Bob"" is tilting at windmills when he says it's not easy to learn Latin. No layman has to learn Latin to understand what is going on at Mass. It is not hard to learn to follow along with a hand missal, and even if you don't want to do that, it doesn't take much experience to figure out what it going on at various times in the Mass.Having said that, however, even though the Second Vatican Council explicitly asked for Latin to be retained in the Mass, the change to the vernacular language is actually the least objectionable of all the changes made in the novus ordo Mass. All of the serious deficiencies of the new Mass would be completely eliminated if we just celebrated the traditional Mass in English or some other vernacular instead."

If they had simply translated the Old Mass into the Vernacular it would not have been such a problem. It was because the Mass which had held the same form (even if little things within it had changed - the general *sensum* was consistent) was suddenly, and dramatically changed. It didn't even resemble that which went before it.Priests were now given options and instructed to use them that they had never been formed to use. I can't imagine how bewildering that must've felt and no wonder so many priests left the priesthood in the 70s."

While some might say that‚Äôs exactly what the Archbishop did, they insult the effort that the Archbishop went to in never insulting and demeaning his lawful superiors. Bishop Williamson did not hesitate to become nasty and publicly insult his lawful superiors once he was expelled. The Archbishop was pained to be forced to part ways with Rome and constantly sought to repair things (to this day the SSPX continues this attempt), Bishop Williamson seemed glad to be rid of the SSPX and to my knowledge never attempted to repair things.Next the most egregious act was his rampant, unwarranted episcopal consecrations, making just about any unhinged cleric a so called bishop. Again some might say that‚Äôs what the Archbishop did, and yet the Archbishop made it quite clear the amount of vetting (obviously not enough) that went into the candidates, as well as the extreme state of necessity for the SSPX‚Äôs episcopal consecrations. Bishop Williamson never bothered to make that clear, just treating the rumor mill as infallible and making anyone who asked into a bishop.These are all public and well known things, frankly it‚Äôs scandalous that so many people want to forget simply because he gave a rousing sermon they happened to hear in the 90‚Äôs and that somehow makes him a saint.

I don't say that to give credence to schsimatics, but only to show that the Greeks do not find issue with the text as a Greek translation.A lot of trads will treat it as some kind of boogeyman bad thing since it isn't the DR, or will not recommend it because it is ""modern,"" but beyond that have little to say.

1iaxzpo,Confused on SSPX position on attending the NO,m9fckbv,None,6,"Hi!It's easy from me to say because I live in France and there are TLMs everywhere, so I don't have any dilemna, but I happen to agree with the SSPX on that issue. To answer your points, it seems you're using both human arguments and doctrinal arguments.Yes, there are SSPX priests who are not virtuous, wise etc. ; there are NO Catholics who are pious and can humble us by their charity etc.However, in order to have a final judment about the NO, one needs to define what exactly is wrong with it. On the outside perspective, which is ours (the faithful), no big difference can be found between a reverent NO Mass in latin and a TLM. However, when the ""Brief Critical Exam of the NO"" was released, the NO they analysed was a reverent NO in latin, and they still saw major problems with it. Sure, the problems aren't easy to spot for us, but if you pay attention to the ""script"" and compare it to the TLM's, you'll notice the sense of sacrifice of Christ (which is the definition of Mass) is completely missing; rather, it's a vague sense of communal meal that's left. So if a priest celebrates it with a traditional mind (meaning believing the Mass is the sacrifice of Christ), it doesn't change the fact the rite is in itself uncatholic.When Luther created the lutheran ""Mass"", he made sure to only change very superficial looking aspects, hoping explicitly (he says it in his books) to change people's faith without them even realizing. That's a historical exampleof why us the faithful should be extremely prudent about rite.Finally, regarding the NO faithful and faith, sadly they often have a non catholic belief regarding many beliefs relating to the Christ the King dogma; most of them believe in Free Speech, in tolerance of false religions, and that false religions aren't essentially evil and that people can be saved through them, etc., and regarding the Mass many of them relativize the Catholic meaning of Mass etc., so we can see the consequences of the NO."
1iaxzpo,Confused on SSPX position on attending the NO,m9g2bml,Ok_Creme3233,7,"Archbishop Lefebvre says one can attend the Novus Ordo:‚ÄúIf one does not have the choice and if the priest celebrating Mass according to the Novus Ordo is faithful and worthy, one should not abstain from going to Mass.‚Äù -Archbishop Lefebvre, 1970This is one of many quotes where Archbishop Lefebvre recommends attending the Novus Ordo if one is unable to attend the Traditional Latin Mass. This is a position that can be endorsed. A person might believe the Traditional Latin Mass is the best expression of the Catholic faith, but if unable to attend the Traditional Latin Mass, one should seek out an orthodox Novus Ordo Mass.‚ÄúMake every effort to have the Mass of St. Pius V, but if it is impossible to find one within forty kilometers and if there is a pious priest who says the New Mass in as traditional a way as possible, it is good for you to assist at it to fulfill your Sunday obligation."" -Archbishop Lefebvre, 1972Once again, Archbishop Lefebvre supports the opinion that the Novus Ordo can and should be attended if no Traditional Latin Mass is available. It is important to note that currently the SSPX holds a different view. Let‚Äôs take a look.The Society as of 2024:-The Novus Ordo is intrinsically offensive to God.-The Novus Ordo is intrinsically sinful to attend.-The Novus Ordo does not fulfill one‚Äôs Sunday obligation.Archbishop Lefebvre, 1972:-There are times when the Novus Ordo Mass can be ‚Äúgood for you to assist at‚Äù.-The Novus Ordo is not intrinsically sinful to attend.-The Novus Ordo can fulfill one‚Äôs Sunday obligation. The Society writes this discrepancy off by explaining that Archbishop Lefebvre wanted to be cautious about condemning the Novus Ordo too soon. However, even five years later, he still was open to the possibility of assisting at the Novus Ordo:‚ÄúTo avoid conforming to the evolution slowly taking place in the minds of priests, we must avoid‚ÄîI could almost say completely‚Äîassisting at the New Mass."" -Archbishop Lefebvre, 1977Here we run into the first issue of the SSPX. They hold that the Novus Ordo is both objectively and intrinsically offensive to God. This must imply that a simple reading of the text of the Novus Ordo Mass is sufficient to definitively determine that it is a sacrilegious rite and offensive to God. However, this view does not seem to match the historical evidence. If a simple reading of the text is enough to determine its intrinsic sinfulness, why did it take Archbishop Lefebvre at least eight years to figure it out? Additionally, here Archbishop Lefebvre states he believes that the Novus Ordo can be celebrated with a totally Catholic faith.‚Äú[The Mass] is ambivalent and ambiguous because one priest can say it with a totally Catholic faith in the sacrifice, etc., and another can say it with a different intention, because the words he pronounces and the gestures he makes no longer contradict [other intentions].""-Archbishop Lefebvre, 1975Early on, Archbishop Lefebvre saw the Novus Ordo as both dangerous and ambiguous, but never as intrinsically and objectively evil, as the SSPX does today. Here is a quote from Marcel Lefebvre: A Biography that reinforces his thoughts:‚ÄúWhen Archbishop Lefebvre was absent on a Sunday, the seminarians would go and assist at Mass together at the Bernadine convent of La Maigrauge where an old monk celebrated the New Mass in Latin.‚ÄùIf the Novus Ordo can be good enough for his seminarians, surely it can be good enough for us! Archbishop Lefebvre emphasized that well-trained, orthodox priests, can provide a Novus Ordo Mass that one can, and at times should, assist at. This is a striking departure from the current language of the SSPX today.However, even if the current SSPX doesn‚Äôt agree with Archbishop Lefebvre, I do. The Traditional Latin Mass is beautiful, reverent, and full of catechesis. It should be attended when possible. However, if no Traditional Latin Mass is available, one should seek out a reverent and orthodox Novus Ordo Mass to attend. By Archbishop Lefebvre‚Äôs ownmetric, this should be done if there is no Traditional Latin Mass within a mere 40 kilometers (25 miles)! That is not a very far drive. Archbishop Lefebvre says that a person should attend a orthodox Novus Ordo Mass if no Traditional Latin Mass is available. He says that this ‚Äúobjectively, inherently, and intrinsically offensive‚Äù Mass can, and sometimes should, be attended. There is an obvious disconnect, a break, between these words of Lefebvre and the current position of the SSPX. This should be looked at and considered seriously. Is the Novus Ordo inherently offensive to God or not? If Archbishop Lefebvre has said the Novus Ordo can be good to attend and can fulfill one‚Äôs Sunday obligation, why does the SSPX now endorse the exact opposite belief? And if the Novus Ordo is objectively, inherently, and intrinsically offensive, how could this change?"
1iaxzpo,Confused on SSPX position on attending the NO,m9e3oof,dbaughmen,5,"Yes, it is possible that the people who attend the NO have the Faith, some NO priests have the Faith too. However, they are in error and attend a Mass that is a generic and faulty rite, even if it not through their fault. Sure, they can be pious, but so can Protestants and even the Orthodox.The question of the ‚Äúreverent NO‚Äù commentated on by SSPX priests, put in simple terms is ‚Äúlipstick on a pig.‚Äù They try to make it beautiful but the very core, the very prayers of this Mass are doctrinally deficient.As for NO confessions, only when it is absolutely necessary, maybe even danger of death. I personally would never receive guidance from a NO priest, because they simply are not trained well at all, I grew up in the NO and speak from experience.Also, yes there can be SSPX priests who are less than ideal, no one is perfect, but their Faith is whole, whilst the NO faith is not.God bless you!"
1iaxzpo,Confused on SSPX position on attending the NO,m9iszwt,Similar_Gap8437,1,"This seems incredibly reasonable.

1iaxzpo,Confused on SSPX position on attending the NO,m9o2sr5,None,1,"I answered this already, but I wanna ad one point; it's interesting that the SSPX is constantly accused by the resistance to be too light compared to Archbishop Lefebvre's positions; and now a new accusation would be the opposite, the SSPX would have secretly become harsher than the archbishop! I think it doesn't make sense to accuse the very structure that studies Archbishop Lefebvre not to know his position on central and essential points"
1iaxzpo,Confused on SSPX position on attending the NO,m9isosy,Similar_Gap8437,0,"YES!!!! This is what I was looking for!!!!! Thank you!!!!!!!!!Are there any priests in the SSPX that still secretly agree with Abp.

Lefebvre vindicate the most conservative of Ecclesia Dei priests from the attacks of the SSPX on them?Why did the SSPX shift their position on this in the last couple decades? Is it out of reaction to the Ecclesia Dei communities? A frustration with the hierarchy on recognizing their ministry?"
1iaxzpo,Confused on SSPX position on attending the NO,m9ldfu9,Dark-Empath-,2,"Agreed.  The Archbishop always comes across as having being prudent, never rushing to conclusions, always trying to give the benefit of the doubt. There is never a rush to condemn or separate, which is a hallmark of the schismatic. Rather, always at pains to do the opposite until he could not continue in good conscience.However, I‚Äôm fairly certain that I read in the early days of the Society that some officials from Rome tried to entice him to celebrate the Novus Ordo Missae, telling him that even if he would perform it just once then all the troubles for him and the Society would disappear. The good Archbishop refused. Not even once."
1iaxzpo,Confused on SSPX position on attending the NO,m9jx0f8,Ok_Creme3233,1,"Hello! Thanks for responding. And thanks for adding the citation for the quotes I used. I realized later that I didn't include it, and wanted to do so when I got home from work. But you did it for me. Appreciate it. I suppose I have two thoughts. First, yes, I acknowledge that Lefebvre's opinion changed, or at least hardened over time. But I think my point is that SSPX holds that the NO Mass is intrinsically offensive to God, and that one could look at merely the text of the Mass to determine this. Would it really take 5+ years for Lefebvre to determine this? Was reading the text really what changed his mind, or something else? Also, from your link which you kindly included above it states at the end, ""Soon, Archbishop Lefebvre would no longer tolerate participation at Masses celebrated in the new rite except passively, for example at funerals."" But it doesn't offer any direct quotes from Lefebvre. It does cite the Spiritual Conferences at Econe in March and April in 1974. I can't find the text of these anywhere online. Any chance you know where one can find them? I'm curious to put his words into context and see exactly what he said. In fact, I have not been able to find ANY quotes of his directly saying that one should never attend the NO Mass. So, if you know of any of quotes of his saying that one should never attend the NO, I'd appreciate those too. Thanks!"
1iaxzpo,Confused on SSPX position on attending the NO,m9kbsdl,Ok_Creme3233,1,"I glad to hear that I helped. These discussion require a lot of wisdom and discernment. I'll pray for both of us in my rosary tonight that we can have those gifts. I feel a bit out of my comfort zone, but I'll do my best to answer the questions you posed. I don't know of any SSPX priests who would openly and publicly encourage someone to attend the NO mass, even if done reverently. That being said, I imagine that there are situations where they would hold that it is actually the best thing to do. For example, as far as I know there are no Latin Masses in Peru, so imagine this: A Peruvian family somehow stumbles across the teachings of the SSPX and decides their positions are the true ones. However, there are zero Latin Masses in their country. To simplify, they have two options: find a reverent and sacred NO mass they can attend, or never receive any more sacraments (I know they could move or something, but for this hypothetical let's just imagine that it isn't an option for whatever reason). I firmly believe that the best option for them would be to find a really good NO mass to attend and start going, to let their children receive the graces from valid sacraments, and do their best to adhere to the true  orthodox faith. Similarly, if someone in prison desires to become Catholic and the only recourse to the faith they have is a NO priest. What should they do? They should seek out that NO priest and receive the sacraments. These are both extreme examples, but I would like to believe that if posed with these scenarios, that a SSPX priest would agree with these outcomes. However, I don't know if any SSPX priests would come out and say this publicly, but perhaps privately. How can we explain the shift from allowing the NO Mass at certain times to it now being offensive to God? I don't have an answer. But, here is my theory. As time went on Lefebvre did  become harsher toward the NO Mass, and I can hardly blame him. There were more and more abuses going on. More and more reports of priests doing crazy things. Sacrilege. Blasphemy. Irreverence galore. And in this age before the internet, the lay people were left to their own devices. Largely, they didn't have access to church documents, and they couldn't look online to see if their priest was the right thing or not. They were completely left on their own, unless they just happened to have books to help them look up orthodoxy. Did their priest slyly teach heresy from the pulpit, how were they to know? In this type of circumstance, yeah, swearing off all NO Masses might be the best thing to do. Lefebvre saw the way the tide was flowing, the Masses were getting worse, and who knows when it would stop. His position, and the position of the SSPX,  as a safeguard became hardened against the NO Mass.  However, now we are in a different scenario. The NO Masses hit rock bottom, and then slowly began to improve. More and more there are priests working hard to make their NO Masses solemn and reverent. They, once again, are celebrating the Mass in a way that brings back the reverence and sacredness of the sacrament. They, once again, are celebrating the Mass in a way that Lefebvre would probably let his seminarians attend if they didn't have any other options. But the SSPX has this problem: in rejecting the NO Mass when it was at its worst, they don't have a way to open it back up now that it is better. Their stance is locked against the NO mass. There is no one who can change it. They're stuck against the NO even as more and more reverent and sacred NO Masses happen around them. So, in short. The NO mass was tolerable for Lefebvre at the start. He felt people could go, especially if they didn't have other options. As things became worse he hardened against the NO. This stance was later codified by the SSPX. Now the NO masses are improving, but the SSPX doesn't have a way to soften their stance. They are stuck in their stance and seem to be holding on to it even though there are reverent and pious NO masses that people ought to be able to attend if they don't have other options."

It seems for the SSPX to soften the stance towards the NO would completely rock the boat. Many faithful and priests could be upset with them and leave or cause divisions.Or maybe this is about doing exactly what Lefebvre taught and then they‚Äôre in a bind.Very interesting history!!!!! Thank you so much for your perspective, it really cleared things up for me. It makes more sense that Lefebvre hardened against the NO as a practical measure, rather than a purely theological analysis of the text. There must be other factors, like you said. If that‚Äôs the case, then we should consider all factors in deciding when and how to attend the NO, not just the text and the political dangers of a liberal hierarchy pushing it."
1iaxzpo,Confused on SSPX position on attending the NO,m9o4f0r,None,1,"To answer your whole example, the premice would need to be defined. Is the NO dangerous in essence? If yes, literally no reason would allow anyone to participate to it, no matter how grave. If you had no chance to meet the Catholic church at all, let's say you lived in a Protestant African tribe and the next Catholic chapel was thousands of kilometers away, would you be able to go? No. One last thing, I'm not judging anyone, my family has made me serve the NO many times in my childhood and like 99% of people going there I had no way knowing it was wrong (meaning I don't think I or most of those people commited a sin). Having the conclusion that one thing is bad doesn't mean that people doing it are commiting a sin, especially in very complex and twisted situations like the Crisis of the Church"
1iaxzpo,Confused on SSPX position on attending the NO,m9j5cc0,Similar_Gap8437,0,"The above comment helped clarify my confusions. I have no problems in accepting the NO is dangerous to the faith. But to say one should never go and that it is sinful to attend requires a strictly technical reading of the text of the new missal, completely separate from the intentions and behaviors of the priest and faithful involved. The comment above clarified that very well for me, referring to Abp. Lefebvre‚Äôs own comments on the issue. My uneasiness stems from precisely my difficulty in accepting the position that it‚Äôs always a sin to attend the new mass while seeking to understand and practice in a traditional catholic way, and agreeing with the core points of the traditional catholic movement."
1iaxzpo,Confused on SSPX position on attending the NO,m9mymoz,Ok_Creme3233,1,"I was just looking at a few more things, and I found this quote:‚ÄúIn the case of the New Mass, it is evident that while still upholding its intrinsic validity, the Archbishop has adopted a more negative stance towards assisting at it than he did in earlier years. This is not surprising, because, as the years have passed, the manner in which the New Mass is celebrated has become consistently more unacceptable in many parishes.‚ÄùHere is the SSPX saying Lefebvre hardened his position, not because of anything intrinsic, but rather because of how it was celebrated.Also, in 1980, Lefebvre said the NO Mass can fulfill the Sunday Obligation:‚ÄúThose who feel themselves obliged in conscience to assist at the New Mass on Sunday can fulfill their Sunday obligation.‚ÄùA belief that the SSPX currently rejects.Here‚Äôs the link where these came from:https://www.sspxasia.com/Documents/Archbishop-Lefebvre/Apologia/Vol_two/Chapter_40.htm"
1iaxzpo,Confused on SSPX position on attending the NO,m9nzmyo,None,1,"I'm not saying it's always a sin, it's always a sin when one does it with full knowledge of the problem of the NO; if you doubt it, it's not the same.I agree that the SSPX's position might seem extreme, it is however true that it is the SSPX's position, and that archbishop Lefebvre, after thinking it true, is had this position. My point was, you only answered the comment going you way, and I don't think it's a good way to seek the truth"

1iaxzpo,Confused on SSPX position on attending the NO,m9o1api,Similar_Gap8437,1,"Understood. I may not have engaged with the SSPX‚Äôs present position deeply in this thread, but I have thought about it. The other comment chain about how the SSPX‚Äôs changes in position show that it has nothing to do with some intrinsic problem in the text, but rather is about other external factors in addition to intrinsic factors, answers my concerns. The change really isn‚Äôt explained any other way, contradicting the SSPX‚Äôs current position.My position so far is that I understand the issues with the NO, but I want to go anyways, albeit with sorrow, as I do not want to stay away, and I want to participate in the sacraments as they are available to me."
1iaxzpo,Confused on SSPX position on attending the NO,m9o71vt,None,1,"One thing first, I'm not judging your decision whatever it's gonna be; a close friend moved to Africa for 2 years and decided to go to the NO there. However, I'd firstly say that this is not the ""SSPX's"" changes, but the Archbishop's, because the former implies the changes were made after the Archbishop's death, implying they betrayed him.Secondly, I'd say that the archbishop's position is mostly about the very text of the NO; he sure studied and understood the NO better than we both did, and his conclusions are based on that (just like the SSPX's position is based on the Brief Critical Study of the NO:[https://angeluspress.org/blogs/catholic-doctrine/a-brief-critical-study-of-the-novus-ordo-missae](https://angeluspress.org/blogs/catholic-doctrine/a-brief-critical-study-of-the-novus-ordo-missae) I think the main reason the archbishop took his time because having this harsh but true position, not only because he saw the consequences of the NO, but mostly because the right of necessity (which is necessary to the SSPX's position) doesn't work as well if the NO isn't essentially problematic. I know it seems your local SSPX priests don't seem the best and I'm sorry about that, I think you should try to find an SSPX priest anywhere and to talk to him!"

1iasyzx,Roman Catholic Daily Missal,m9dbnfx,Piklikl,3,"Not sure which one you have but they all are usually organized the same way: in the middle of the Missal you'll have the Mass itself, or rather the prayers of the Mass that stay the same for every Mass (called the Commons). There are parts of the Mass that change based on the day, called the Propers, these are the Introit, Collect, Epistle, Gradual/Alleluia/Tract, Gospel, Offertory, Secret, Communion, and Post Communion.On the ""left"" of the Commons, or in the earlier part of the Missal you'll have the Propers for the Sunday Masses. On the ""right"" of the Commons, or later on in the Missal you'll have the Propers for the weekday Masses. If there's no Mass for a feast day that's called a Ferial and the priest will usually say the Mass from the preceding Sunday, though sometimes he'll say a votive Mass instead (and typically the priest will announce what votive Mass he is saying).Every Mass starts off the same with the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar (part of the Commons), then after that the priest will say the Introit (part of the Propers), so if you're following along you flip to the Introit for the Mass of the day, then you'll flip back to the Commons for the Kyrie and Gloria, then flip to the Propers for the Collect, Epistle, and Gradual/Alleluia/Tract, then flip to the Commons for the Mundae Cor Meum prayer, flip to the Propers for the Gospel, etc etc.Typically most Missals will have more directions and page numbers ""teaching"" you how to use the Missal for the First Sunday of Advent, so if you find that in your Missal it should help you figure it out.It would be swell if someone made a video explaining how to use the Missal, I think a lot of things would end up being improved because we would all benefit from it.Also if you go [this website](https://www.divinumofficium.com/cgi-bin/missa/missa.pl) it will have everything you need on one webpage so you don't need to worry about knowing where to find things.

Specifically, on the conflict between traditionalists (like Messrs. Buckley and Davies) who loved the Tridentine Mass, and reformers (like Monsignor Champlin) who support the Novus Ordo mandated by Vatican II. JC: ""You liked the old worship because the 'I' was able to pray, and you weren't kind of impinged by the priest or other people? That kind of notion? ..."" WFB: ""It gave me a sense that the priest was there as a mediator between me and God, whereas it seems to me that the existing approach tends to be sort of crowd-oriented."" JC: ""I think that's the key thing right there.... Before Vatican II, when I was ordained in '56, the Mass was very much a mystery. I was a priest with my back to the people, in Latin, there was silence in the congregation.... The Council, then, going back to the best traditions of the early Church, said it's both 'I' and 'we' together. It's a vertical worship, yes, but it's also a horizontal worship.""*"

1i9g8ic,We need more bishops,m9ve7qd,Naft_814,1,"I'm not sure why you think I'm assuming too much from the phrase when I quite literally am using the quote word for word, unless the quote isn't actually real/worded differently, then I would concede that Archbishop Lefebvre never actually said that. I know why Jackleclash used it, and we would agree on various things. Certainly, Jackleclash and I would agree on things such as if the sspx were to discontinue then its an obvious sign it wasn't from God. But what I'm pointing out is the first part of the quote and saying that it's a problem. Just because it is continuing does not mean it's from God. But one who supports the sspx would see that quote, see that the sspx is continuing, and therefore logically conclude that the sspx is from God. But what I'm simply pointing out is that isn't sufficient because that same logic can apply to other positions. I could be a Baptist pastor and tell someone in my congregation the same thing about our church. That would alleviate their worries but it doesn't mean that it's correct. It's either from God or it isn't, if it's from God then it's good for your soul, if it isn't then it's not good for your soul, simply remaining in existence doesnt make it of God. However, you have to know whether or not it's from God and can't gamble on waiting around to see if it ends or not. What if the sspx ended tomorrow, what about all of the souls who followed the sspx that passed before seeing that it ended? Many people believe the sspx to be the best means of salvation, so much to where if a family member of theirs is still Catholic but no longer goes to and supports the sspx then they're seen as putting their soul in danger. So the root question is what if the sspx position is wrong but still continuing? Is it still of God, is it still ok for one to follow their position?"

If the SSPX were to be reduced to one bishop, then the need to consecrate would be urgent. If the SSPX were reduced to one aged and infirm bishop, as it was in 1988, then the need to consecrate would be immediate."

Another consecration without explicit authorization would be far less ‚Äúambiguously necessary‚Äù than the last ones.*I didn't say that. My own preference is that the Society would receive canonical recognition. IMO, the best structure would be a personal ordinariate, rather than a prelature, but thats a detail issue. Nonetheless, if we do not receive recognition, I believe it is still nessecary for episcopal consecrations to ensure the continuance of the Society. Obviously, it would be best for the Vatican to give permissions, but failing that, withholding condemnation is the next best thing."
1i9g8ic,We need more bishops,m9djc0s,rathdrummob,1,"It would stand to reason that any ""necessity"" would need to be determined by Rome to avoid a reimposition of the excommunications of the same bishops who had their prior excommunications lifted. The whole purpose of lifting their previous excommunication was to make reconciliation possible.  Therefore, in my totally irrelevant opinion, another illicit consecration by the SSPX would remove any doubt that they have no interest or intention toward working for any form of regularization of their standing within the Catholic Church, and are willfully choosing to run out the possibility for the future. I doubt that this Holy Father or any who would follow would give them another chance."
1i9g8ic,We need more bishops,m9dxzwi,Willsxyz,3,"I see. I did not know at first that you were discussing from the point of view of one who thinks that there is no reason for the SSPX to exist, and that it would be best if the SSPX simply folded itself into the FSSP (with their probable suppression shortly thereafter). I suppose you would have also counseled Archbishop Lefebrve to stop being recalcitrant and just go ahead and celebrate the Novus Ordo Mass The SSPX does not agree with your point of view. Neither do I.Still, let me add that excommunications were never ""imposed"" on the bishops. Rather, the motu proprio Ecclesia Dei stated that they were (automatically) excommunicated as provided for in canon law. The distinction is important, because whether or not they were excommunicated depends not on a single sentence in canon law, but rather the whole of canon law. I am not trying to debate whether or not they were excommunicated here, just pointing out that there is a difference between your assumption about what happened and what the motu proprio actually said. Even at the time there were professors of canon law who stated that the motu proprio was wrong and that the SSPX bishops were not actually excommunicated. Of course there were also those who took the opposite position.In any case, the position of Archbishop Lefebvre and of the SSPX is that there is a crisis in the Church and that it is necessary for the SSPX to continue maintaining the traditional doctrine of the Church and the traditional formation of priests until the crisis is over, and that this necessity requires the SSPX to continue to ordain priests and thus also to consecrate bishops."
1i9g8ic,We need more bishops,m9li63w,rathdrummob,1,"Ok, semantics, the archbishop and the 4 were excommunicated latae sententiae, I misspoke. It was a consequence that they ""imposed"" upon themselves and yet it was rescinded by the pope. The 2 remaining bishops are not currently excommunicate, I'd imagine that they would like to keep it that way. As to your first point, that isn't a correct characterization of my point of view regarding the Society. My opinion right now is that they don't seem to have any will towards any type of licit status inside the church, while still claiming that they are ""in communion"" with the church. They seem quite comfortable on the sidelines, safely out of the fray. At least in my experience around the US, they operate their chapels and ""missions"" absent any contact or concern regarding the local Ordinary of the Diocese. This was not so much the case before. There are very practical concerns at this point that make the question of any sort of arrangement with Rome seem self defeating. If they did end up with some agreement, probably half their supporters would leave, probably with a significant number of priests. (Look what happened when it was just mentioned as a possibility, especially  Bp Williamson, who spun that situation way out of control) Conversely, if thy were to consecrate new bishops, they would be faced with the opposite problem. A bunch of people and priests would leave, like last time, it would just be other group. I've discussed this with an SSPX priest and this was his take. (So one man's opinion, but a very well reasoned one) So the practical reality of any substantial erosion of support could be catastrophic to the society just from the standpoint of maintaining the amount of real estate that they own. I really feel that they have boxed themselves into something of a corner. They're smart guys, but it's going to take a pretty nuanced maneuvering to get through it and manage the blowback. And one last point, since this thread is getting hijacked, I suppose in some part by me, so I'll stop after this. I really am surprised by all of the sentimentality on display over Bp Williamson by supporters of the SSPX. The guy really went off the rails, he spent his last decade in public opposition to the SSPX, headed up the Resistance group, consecrated like 7 (?) illicit bishops... he was an incredibly intelligent, and charismatic man, who held much influence over many souls- but he had a major problem with pride and discretion and consequently fostered much confusion and distress among well meaning and trusting people. I hope he can rest in peace, but he lead a public life in unrepentant public scandal."

1i8w6ay,Question,m8xhfpp,SanctusFranciscus,3,"Sedevacantist - No present Pontiff, not in communion with present hierarchy. SSPX - Pontiff and Church are real but there are  concerns about their orthodoxy and liturgical praxis. Not invited by local Bishop, irregular communion (not no communion).FSSP - Pontiff and Church are real and the situation is such that you can adhere to the modern Church, remain in normal communion and still be traditionally minded. Invited by local Bishop."
1i8w6ay,Question,m92jq11,None,1,"You can find many different private positions depending on the priest; here are the official positions:    Sedevacantism : The Pope's seat is vacant since \~ Pius XII. There are no Pope since then, the people claiming to be Popes are heretic usurpers. The NO Mass is invalid, the NO bishops and priests are invalid too.The SSPX : Vatican 2 contradicts the Faith and cannot be adhered to for a Catholic. The NO Mass is dangerous for the faith and should not be attended to/celebrated. This doesn't mean Francis isn't the Pope, but it does mean that the situation is dangerous enough for the faith for traditional priests/bishops to use the right of extraordinary jurisdiction (the right to give sacraments without the authorization of the Pope)The FSSP (an most other ex ED institutes, but there are differences): Vatican 2 doesn't essentially contradict the faith and can be adhered to. The difference between the NO and the TLM is essentially a question of personal preference, the NO is a fertile rite as well (but in private most priests say that the NO is at least not as good as the TLM, and has some issues with it). The situation is not grave enough to use the right of necessity to get extraordinary jurisdiction.   Other differences: sedes have many bishops, the consecrate them when they think it useful. The SSPX has few bishops, it considers that it cannot consecrate bishops without grave need. The FSSP has no bishops, its priests are ordained by conservative bishops.If you need more precisions don't hesitate to ask!"

1i8w6ay,Question,m94k4cb,mineuserbane,1,"This is backwards. To anyone else reading this u/dbaughmen is a sedevacantist and is attempting to justify his position. To clarify but not defend: the teachings of Fr. Feeney are suppressed. Some of his followers adhere to a heretical version of Feeneyism, some are in full communion with the church and have been allowed to continue his work as long as they don't cross the line into heresy. To the contrary, sedevacantism has been condemned universally as heresy. Anyone adhering to it is anathema per Vatican I. Feeneyites may be heretics depending on their interpretation of Ecclesiam Nulla Salus or may be hardline traditional Catholics. Sedevacantists are outside of the fold of the Catholic Church for multiple reasons."

1i8foy9,Moving soon - do I stick with the sspx or go to the parish with a larger community and daily mass?,m8tgwk7,Piklikl,11,"The Faith is about so much more than just the Mass on Sunday; the FSSP is a blatant affront to the traditions of the Church (most diocesan priests can be given the benefit of the doubt, but all Ecclesiastical Dei priests have explicitly been made aware of and willing embrace the innovations of V2).It sounds cliche, but be the change you want to see in the world. You don‚Äôt like the smaller SSPX community? Get involved and see what you can do to help grow it. Offer up to God the difficulties you have and the sacrifice you are making by doing so.While no raindrop can be blamed for the flood, I certainly think that we will all be held to account for our contribution to the crisis in the Church (laypeople quite a bit less so than the clergy). The large FSSP/diocesan communities you‚Äôre scoping out clearly have no need for more people, and the SSPX community clearly needs more. It seems like you‚Äôre wanting to make the selfish decision to go where no work, no contribution is required from you, and I urge you to resist that temptation."

1i8foy9,Moving soon - do I stick with the sspx or go to the parish with a larger community and daily mass?,m8voq5d,None,4,"Hi!I'm an SSPX parishioner, but I often go to FSSP Mass on Sundays because I'm a scout chief in an FSSP parish.I had the dilemma of giving up being a scout chief to go solely in an FSSP parish. Here are the 2 arguments in favor of that:- getting communion from a priest symbolizes being in communion with him; officially, the FSSP accepts V2 and the NO. Therefore, getting communion would mean being in communion with those- going to an FSSP parish means getting FSSP friends, FSSP sermons, FSSP parish catechism, etc. : it's impossible not to be influenced, ""a man is nothing but the sum of his friends"".So my conclusion was that the first argument doesn't necessarily work (since the priest in this FSSP parish doesn't formally accept Vatican 2), but the 2nd definitely does. However, the 2nd also depends on some factors: if you're really well formed, going to the FSSP in rare and exceptional occasions won't hurt too much. I personally became more and more strongly convinced of the SSPX's position since I started being in touch with the FSSP. But I also came to the conclusion that going there ""full time"" as regular parish.So I understand your reasons, it does sound very tempting, sometimes the SSPX seems to be a refuge for social outcasts, but so was early christianity, doctrine goes before social life even if it is sometimes a big sacrifice. Once you start going to a parish, if you appreciate the community, you might be tempted to go there more and more.Don't forget the FSSP is allowed to be installed everywhere the SSPX is: this shows that the Vatican's goal is to drain the SSPX into the FSSP. Let's not fall in the trap liberal bishops we keep complaining about! Most of the FSSP parishioners/priests are very good people, but sadly their official positions aren't good, and the don't have bishops like the SSPX does that could save tradition.

I‚Äôm just answering a question because it was asked. And my advice is based on my own experience. No honest person anywhere in any SSPX congregation (they‚Äôre not parishes) would ever say that the communities don‚Äôt attract a pretty odd crowd. And in the smaller groups, you really don‚Äôt get a big enough sample to be able to find ‚Äúyour people‚Äù so to speak, especially if you‚Äôre young and/or single. So if a person wants to make friends and give themselves a shot at finding like minded friends, they‚Äôll need to pragmatically join a community that would maximize the chance of that. I lived in SSPX priories and missions for 5 decades all over the country and I would never advise anyone to look to a small SSPX mission for community. They might find it, but most likely won‚Äôt.

1i08y91, Bible recommendations ,m6w4v5r,No-Test6158,9,"Douay-Rheims is the standard. There have been revisions made to it. The American Edition of 1899 is the version that is most commonly used in the US. There are some other versions. Rt Rev Challoner made some changes to it in the 1700s and Mgr. Knox made some further revisions in the 1900s. My large bible is Knox OT and Douay-Rheims Challoner NT. The latter two are the more common text for English speakers in Europe.It's a matter of choice though - if the traditional language isn't your cup of tea, any Catholic Bible will do.

1hz5vvg,Confirmation question‚Ä¶,m6qjo5h,Piklikl,4,"As other users have commented, the sacrament is valid or not, not you the person. If for some reason your confirmation by a bishop of the SSPX was invalid, you would still be a Catholic and can participate in the other sacraments; it wouldn‚Äôt really affect anything (though once you learn that it‚Äôs invalid you should of course do what can to remedy it). The only sacrament that has effects on other sacraments is Baptism because the character you receive at Baptism is what allows you to receive the other sacraments.Most of the snarky comments I‚Äôve received from NO Catholics stem from them thinking that you can‚Äôt fulfill your Sunday obligation at the SSPX, which is simply false."
1hz5vvg,Confirmation question‚Ä¶,m6paelv,Jumpy_Cardiologist61,4,You can go to the Novus Ordo for social reasons like a wedding/funeral. I went to a friend's Novus Ordo wedding this past weekend and just didn't receive communion.I go to an SSPX church and I don't know anyone that would refuse to go to a Novus Ordo wedding/funeral. I don't think that's a thing.
1hz5vvg,Confirmation question‚Ä¶,m77n82f,USAFrenchMexRadTrad,2,"I think the SSPX position is that while the Novus Ordo sacraments are valid, the wording of the prayers has had Catholic doctrine watered down to the point that it's easier for the Novus Ordo priest to invalidate the Novus Ordo sacrament, especially if the Novus Ordo priest is poorly formed in the Catholic faith, as is the case with many Catholics nowadays.It used to be that whenever you bumped into an ex-Catholic, they'd be less hostile to the Catholic faith and more educated on it. Now you have still practicing Catholics who don't believe in the true presence of Christ in the Eucharist and say things that are incorrect, like ""I was born Catholic."" We are baptized Catholic, to be clear.And the ex-Catholics nowadays don't seem to know anything about their former faith and are extremely hostile to it.It's rare to meet an ex-Catholic who just didn't believe and has no personal grudge and is very well educated on their former faith.... and one can't help but suspect the Novus Ordo sacraments and the watering down of Catholic doctrine in the wording of the prayers has something to do with it.That old axiom comes to mind: ""Lex Orandi, Lex Credendi"", the law of prayer is the law of belief."
1hz5vvg,Confirmation question‚Ä¶,m6n073j,Fravashi_Yazatas,1,"Everyone I‚Äôve met at SSPX refuses to attend NO, and many people tell me that SSPX is not attached to Rome properly. My old NO priest ‚Äúhates‚Äù me right now. It took months of me demanding my baptismal certificate so I could show SSPX priest that I‚Äôm not married, and without nearly all sacraments, but was enrolled and attending NO OCIA until I went to first SSPX Mass on 01 Dec last year and haven‚Äôt been back to NO since‚Ä¶I know they know where I‚Äôm going and the one time I showed up at the learning hall I was needled by their comments, even though they tried to camouflage them. If I‚Äôm confirmed at an SSPX and let‚Äôs say they‚Äôre all cutoff from Rome in October for any reason , am I actually confirmed or not?"
1hz5vvg,Confirmation question‚Ä¶,m6n0m2m,Duibhlinn,11,"Well first of all the SSPX is not ""all cutoff from Rome"". All SSPX priests are validly ordained Catholic priests, and the SSPX Bishops are validly ordained Catholic Bishops. All the Sacraments provided by the SSPX priests and Bishops are valid, real, Catholic Sacraments. If you are confirmed by an SSPX Bishop then you have received a valid Confirmation from a Catholic Bishop.The people you have met who refuse to attend the Novus Ordo probably won't attend because that Mass is inferior to the Mass which came before it, which is what the priests of the SSPX say. Many books could, and have been, written on why but for your purposes the exact details probably aren't that important or relevant. That is simply the reason why. The position of the SSPX is that the Novus Ordo Sacraments are valid but basically inferior to the older ones. Baptism for example is particularly inferior to the older rite."
1hz5vvg,Confirmation question‚Ä¶,m6n177d,Fravashi_Yazatas,1,"Why does everyone at my new choice of location for Sunday Mass absolutely refuse to set foot back in a church that only does NO? What am I to do when I‚Äôm forced to attend funerals for my father‚Äôs side of the family, being Catholics, and/or friends weddings that aren‚Äôt being particularly called to come with me to SSPX quite yet, or maybe never?"
1hz5vvg,Confirmation question‚Ä¶,m6n208f,Duibhlinn,3,">Why does everyone at my new choice of location for Sunday Mass absolutely refuse to set foot back in a church that only does NO?Well I'm not a mind reader so I can't say what every single person there thinks, but generally traditional Catholics such as those who attend the Latin Mass which the SSPX offers have various reasons why they don't attend the Novus Ordo. Have you tried asking them? You're clearly quite new to all of this, if you just ask them, or ask the SSPX priest, and say you genuinely just don't have a clue why, then they will probably tell you why. It isn't because they are somehow not Catholic. People attending the SSPX Mass are attending the same Mass that their parents and grandparents going back for centuries have, it's practically the same Mass as the 6th century Mass with minimal differences.The answers you hear vary from person to person but most generally agree that the old Mass is superior, and that there are to one degree or another deficiencies in the new Mass which are not present in the old Mass. I mean think of the Sacrament of marriage: the most abuse, hateful marriage and the most loving, holy marriage may both be valid marriages, but you know which one of them you would prefer to have. The same is true of the new and old Mass, both are valid but one is far better than the other."
1hz5vvg,Confirmation question‚Ä¶,m6n47g5,Numbainne47,1,"They refuse to because they choose not to for whatever reason, it's there choice. If you know someone having a wedding at a novus ordo and you want to attend, then do it. Plenty of people at my sspx chapel will refuse to attend a novus ordo, and i know plenty that have no problem attending a novus ordo and do so semi regularly when the sspx doesnt have mass. At the end of the day it's your choice."
1hz5vvg,Confirmation question‚Ä¶,m6n5qa9,mineuserbane,-3,Refusing to be in communion with those in communion with Rome incurs automatic excommunication. I'd be careful walking along the edge of a knife if I were you.

It is dangerous to your faith. Realistically what would happen is you would either be angry/depressed every time by irreverence/priests saying stuff that isn't Catholic teaching, or you would gradually assimilate.Especially since you're a new Catholic: you won't have the formation to be able to tell what's right and what's wrong so you'll just drink it in.There are many Church-approved circumstances for when the Sunday obligation ceases to bind.My copy of ""Moral Theology"" by Fr. Heribert Jone (a pre-Vatican II moral theology manual for priests) says this:""III. Excuses from assisting at Mass. Any moderately grave reason suffices to excuse one from assistance at Holy Mass, such as considerable hardship or corporal or spiritual harm either to oneself or another.""If you regularly attend the Novus Ordo, there is a very good chance you will suffer spiritual harm. Therefore, you are not obligated to go.If the Institute of the Good Shepherd Mass is an hour or less away, I would do that. A lot of people at my SSPX church travel 45 minutes-1 hour to be there. If not every Sunday, at least 1-2x per month, as another person said.I would also try to re-arrange your class schedule to make it more compatible with the Archdiocesan Latin Mass. You should be able to choose other classes at different times, do some classes online, etc.If you need to, you could watch a live-streamed Latin Mass on YouTube on Sunday, but that isn't a long-term solution.With the baptism and formation thing, I would figure out a game plan with the priest. They are correct about the emergency baptism thing, that's more for if there's imminent danger of death. You should be able to read a traditional catechism on your own and meet with them periodically 1-on-1 to ask questions.In the meantime, our SSPX priest had my wife and I read this catechism for our marriage prep and it was very good:[https://www.amazon.com/Brief-Catechism-Adults-Complete-Handbook/dp/0895554925/ref=sr\_1\_1?crid=37RT7NAMENI5B&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Z-nqkxsY5nrOOybVhOV19YBGBb1yKNcgdW0MjhfDqMQjBR-U09wv4Z\_zrVW0Yii1\_PIemb4gTE93eist\_L5bTNweTU1L-pebBEcEQyvzh\_VYio1-YO\_CaPUany1NjFU0BX8Tld91w8Pehu8vByTioQ.HDh\_FJCrVqGBJ1Bgyd7aUJA\_Cqh0eDkMtal8lGp3E4I&dib\_tag=se&keywords=cogan+catechism&qid=1736612193&sprefix=cogan+catechism%2Caps%2C124&sr=8-1](https://www.amazon.com/Brief-Catechism-Adults-Complete-Handbook/dp/0895554925/ref=sr_1_1?crid=37RT7NAMENI5B&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Z-nqkxsY5nrOOybVhOV19YBGBb1yKNcgdW0MjhfDqMQjBR-U09wv4Z_zrVW0Yii1_PIemb4gTE93eist_L5bTNweTU1L-pebBEcEQyvzh_VYio1-YO_CaPUany1NjFU0BX8Tld91w8Pehu8vByTioQ.HDh_FJCrVqGBJ1Bgyd7aUJA_Cqh0eDkMtal8lGp3E4I&dib_tag=se&keywords=cogan+catechism&qid=1736612193&sprefix=cogan+catechism%2Caps%2C124&sr=8-1)If you have specific questions, you can also ask [mastercatechism.com](http://mastercatechism.com)"

This is because prayers and actions in the traditional mass that expressed defined dogmas of the Church were intentionally stripped from the new mass for bad reasons (whether to please protestants, or to destroy the Catholic faith itself, etc.).Therefore SSPX priests refuse to celebrate the new mass and advise the faithful to not attend a new mass, arguing that no one has the authority to obligate Catholics to attend a mass that is deficient in such a way.

Statistically, the Novus Ordo will probably do to him what it has already done to most other Catholics.If I choose 100 Novus Ordo Catholics at random, how many of them go to Mass on Sundays, don't use contraception, etc.? 1 or 2?It is possible that the OP will be part of the 1-2%, but it is more likely that he'll be part of the 98-99%. Those are not odds I feel comfortable recommending to him.Second, every Catholic-related statistic has collapsed since the 1960s. Mass attendance, baptisms, marriages, fertility rate, seminarians, number of priests, number of nuns, conversions, etc.Jesus says ""By their fruits you shall know them"" and the fruits of the Novus Ordo have been a complete and utter catastrophe.Third, it's not ""the entire magisterium."" Off the top of my head, I can think of Cardinal Ottaviani, Cardinal Bacci, Cardinal Heenan, Archbishop Dwyer, Bishop Schneider, Bishop Strickland, and Bishop Huonder who all share my assessment.""The Novus Ordo represents, both as a whole and in its details, a striking departure from the Catholic theology of the Mass as it was formulated in Session XXII of the Council of Trent.""  \-Cardinal OttavianiCardinal Ottaviani was head of the Holy Office.

1hyoc1c,I am unable of going to Tridentine Mass. What should I do?,m7zbnt3,mineuserbane,2,"To start, I don't attend the Novus Ordo and am not in the habit of defending it. However, it is a valid mass and is the ordinary method provided for fulfilling the Sunday obligation. I am not arguing the Novus Ordo is beneficial to the church, I'm arguing it is better to attend the Novus Ordo than miss Mass. Missing Mass on Sundays, without a valid dispensation, is a mortal sin. The Novus Ordo existing is not a valid dispensation. The 1-2% stat is pulled out of thin air. I would argue that this number is not anywhere near realistic. If it is realistic, the argument still fails. Your argument relies on the fact that a Catholic would lose their faith due to bad influence from other Catholics. If someone's faith is so weak that this would be true, they wouldn't be able to go out into the world and live a normal life. They would not be able to go to work and associate with the rest of society as it would be a danger to their soul. This is not how the Church teaches you should live your life. The entire premise of your argument fails. Regarding the entire magisterium, of the prelates you mentioned, only two are alive. Those two, Schneider and Strickland, celebrate the Novus Ordo regularly and would completely disagree with you on this point. From what I know of the others, they also celebrated the new mass despite sounding the warnings of some of its abuses. The main guy in charge of doctrine at the Vatican now also disagrees with you. No one holding valid authority would agree with you on this point. As a result, you DO appeal to your own authority in disagreement with the authority the church provided for you. That is a very dangerous moral position. It's even worse to preach this lie."
1hyoc1c,I am unable of going to Tridentine Mass. What should I do?,m6mmgxs,mineuserbane,0,That is correct. Canon Law requires attending a mass in full communion with Rome. For that reason neither an Orthodox liturgy nor a sedevacantist mass would fulfil one's obligation. Yet a diocesan NO would.

Starting from humility, misunderstandings, wisdom, charity, etc. These are only my observations. As I encounter them online through their behavior to Rome and to Catholic churches, even shrines and attacking and condeming priests of the SSPX, accusing the whole society and to Bishop Fellay that the good bishops sold the SSPX to Rome as they're allergic to novus ordo parishes. I'm Not judging them but You shall know by their fruits. but I admire their perseverance to the faith except I'm just being cautious to be near them. If our BVM and Our Lord is in their care, so be it as they are still Catholics holding on to salvation.We still already have the majority of the SSPX institution/congregation. 3 Bishops where still united for the salvation of souls and we have to stay in the channel.

At best, they have no real presence and just continue doing their particular thing, serving chapels in village halls or converted barns. At worst, they can become drawn into more extreme views such as the sede camp. The resistance as it has come to be known, has become a bit of a rallying point for Catholics with views that are, for lack of a better word, extreme. They have a tendency to be inclined towards a more conspiratorial view of the world. They are often aligned to the now excommunicated Bishop Williamson. And that's a whole different story.Do not be tempted by false pomp and tales of how they are ""protecting tradition"" - this is a ploy designed to take you out of the church.

Fellay in 2012 when he wanted to sign a ""practial agreement"" with Rome so that they could get the SSPX ""officially recognized"" by the Vatican. There is a complete timeline [here](https://www.therecusant.com/reference-materials), judge for yourself. The declaraction was never signed, but the Resistance suspects Fellay to still wanting to sign it, so they stay out of the SSPX and accused Fellay of being a modernist who wants the Society to basically be a new FSSP / ICKSP. The talks between Rome and the SSPX came to a stop after Williamsons famous interview on the holocaust.Williamson was told to stop his ""Eleison Comments"" newsletter, which he didn't, and Fellay kicked him out because of ""disobedience"" (but really, it was about the direction of the SSPX: uniting with Rome on a practical, but not dogmatic level and risking liberalism or staying separate from Rome and getting accused of schism).Since Williamson was then the only bishop in the world to not bow to Zionism (like both Ratzinger and Fellay), he went ahead and consecrated four new bishops, citing the same jurisdiction of emergency as Lefevbre in 1988. Fellay condemned this as a schismatic act, but now has the problem that the Vatican doesn't want to approve new bishops for them either without the SSPX agreeing to Vatican II.I personally side with the Resistance because I read the 2012 letters, but I still go to the SSPX for sacraments and there are also priests in the SSPX who occasionally keep contact to Williamson. The Resistance priests are notably more conservative than the SSPX, but they aren't sedevacantists. The Resistance is *intentionally* not one organization, because they fear they'd be subverted from within. So they keep separate groups (Hewko, Pfeiffer, Williamson, Chazal, Dominicans of Avrille, Bp. Aquinas in Brazil, etc.)."

As an example, whether it is a historical fact, or not, that approximately 6 million European Jews were murdered by the Nazi government of Germany is not an article of Catholic faith, and even though Bishop Williamson seems to be particularly interested in this question, he has no obligation to publicly expound upon it and can legitimately be enjoined from doing so by his lawful superior."

First, he did one interview. He didn't constantly publicly hammer on about the Holocaust. What should he have done, turn back time?Second, he defended himself in court against the German State, not against Fellay, to have the right to say his opinion (and to stay out of jail). He did even comply with Fellays order to exchange his attorney for a pro-Zionist one.Third, Williamsons expulsion had nothing to do with his holocaust interview (even priests in the Society today admit this). The interview happened in 2010, the expulsion was in 2012, over two years later, when the media frenzy had already died down. It had everything to do with Fellays ""six preamble"" letter, where he wanted to reconcile (aka sellout) the Society to modernist Rome and Williamson (and a few other priests) blocking that.The problem is, that the entire purpose of the SSPX is to NOT reconcile with Rome as long as Rome is modernist (now even more than in 1988). That is where the jurisdiction comes from, it doesn't come from the Pope, it comes from the fact that 99% of Catholics sign off on heresy. So, in other words, Fellays current direction to reconcile is against the original purpose of the SSPX.Anyway, I guess the people who understand why Williamson did what he did (he esp. feared Zionism infiltrating the Society), understand why the Society now is ""nicer"" to Rome (who are also under Zionist control). Certainly, the fact that Maximilian Krah, an Israeli-allied ""Christian"" was in charge of the finances at the time, also didn't help. Williamson did nothing wrong, neither morally (anyone should be able to speak about the holocaust) nor ecclesiastically (he was right to resist Fellays course because it would undermine the mission of the Society and its jurisdiction)."

The SSPX upholds the teachings of the Church that the salvation of souls is the highest law, to the point that its leaders have disobeyed/displeased the Pope rather than contravene that highest law. This was most apparent in 1988 when the SSPX consecrated 4 Bishops so as to ensure the continuation of its mission of forming priests in the traditional methods as a way ensuring the access of the faithful to the sacraments confected in the traditional ways (Archbishop Lefebrve, realized that Rome was simply stalling and way for him to die, so he made the difficult decision of proceeding with the consecrations in light of the extraordinary circumstances). To put it simply, the SSPX would rather offend the men who happen to be installed in the Vatican rather than offend God. Obviously this is a strange and tenuous circumstance (imagine your mother tells you to do something that you think is wrong, it‚Äôs not right for a child to be put in that position but ultimately the child must follow their conscience even if it offends the parent), and several priests of the SSPX thought that the episcopal consecrations were a bridge too far (in spite of the fact that the SSPX had almost always been disobeying the men in the Vatican in one way or another) and left the SSPX and went to Rome asking for a way to celebrate the traditional liturgy while maintaining good relations with the Vatican. The Vatican formed a commission to oversee these priests called the Ecclesia Dei Commission, there‚Äôs a few difference organizations underneath this commission (FSSP and ICKSP are the two largest and most well known), but ultimately the groups were allowed to exist on the condition that they accept everything the Vatican has promulgated, including everything promulgated at the pastoral council of Vatican 2, explicitly as a way of getting the faithful who are ‚Äúattached‚Äù to the traditional liturgy to become more open to the innovations of Vatican 2. Individual priests belonging to the groups might express criticisms of Vatican 2, but these are purely personal opinions (and certainly not values as they are unwilling to suffer for them), when push comes to shove the Ecclesia Dei priests cannot criticize the Council or the Vatican and have formally accepted the changes in the Church. A person who claims to be a Christian and who does everything that a Christian does, and only puts just one little grain of incense on the altar of a false god cannot be a Christian; so it is with these Ecclesia Dei priests.They want to have their cake and eat it too: they have an emotional attachment to the liturgy and are willing to sacrifice principles (accepting the innovations of V2) in order to not feel like they are breaking with the men who happen to be in positions of power in the Vatican at the present time.Ultimately only time will reveal the error of their ways, and it could very well take centuries."

I just went wherever a Tridentine Mass was offered.It's only through time that I have started to see the major differences. In practice, and from experience, the biggest difference between the ED and Diocesan Latin Masses is to them it's all a matter of appearance **not** a rooted culture and faith. Since I have been attending the SSPX, I have found that it is much more cultural as well as the liturgy. In this respect, the SSPX is very much a continuation of the church, as it was, in 1962. Sure, I've sat through some bad liturgies at SSPX masses, but I've also sat through a 2 hour pre-1955 Palm Sunday liturgy at a Diocesan parish which was ""performed"" for the 2 old ladies in the parish who go to everything. There is never any social occasions around the ED/Diocesan masses. It's all rather business like. Come in, do mass, leave.

As others have said, the FSSP / ICKSP's official position is that everything in Vatican II is reconcilable with Tradition, and that the Novus Ordo vs. the Latin Mass is just a matter of personal taste. As long as you celebrate the Novus Ordo reverently, their position is that it's fine.    The SSPX's position is that some parts of Vatican II are fine but other things are not reconcilable with Tradition (religious liberty, etc.) and that the Novus Ordo is objectively deficient in important ways.That's pretty much the dividing line. The SSPX could regularize its canonical status anytime they wanted if they were willing to endorse Vatican II and the Novus Ordo, and they refuse to do so because they think both of those things are at the heart of the crisis that is afflicting the Church.Privately, a lot of FSSP / ICKSP priests don't agree with the official position and do think there are issues with Vatican II and the Novus Ordo, but they're not going to say that publicly because they would get in trouble.Another difference is that the FSSP and ICKSP are not going to say anything publicly that could get them cancelled.

To the lay person whose exposure to the Liturgy of the Catholic Church is only attending Mass, it would indeed be difficult to distinguish the difference between the SSPX and the Ecclesia Dei Groups, and consequently to care about the differences.However the Church has always taught that your faith and the way you pray are inextricably linked (lex orandi, lex credendi). Consequently what you believe will impact how you pray (and how you pray will impact what you believe). Catholicism is so much more than the liturgy of the Mass, and it‚Äôs a mistake to think that to live the Faith to its fullest is simply a matter of only attending Mass that is celebrated in a particular way.

1hwzgws,How do you reconcile the Society‚Äôs view on canonizations?,m65cahk,USAFrenchMexRadTrad,5,"From what I understand, there are two things mentioned when someone is canonized. One is that they're in Heaven, therefore a Saint. That part invokes authority in its declaration.The second part says the person is worth emulating. That statement doesn't have any sort of authoritative phrasing attached to it.Let's take a very obvious example. St. John Paul II. Supposedly, he was nominated for canonization for his personal piety and powerful prayer life. As an administrator of the Church? He mostly delegated to others and was known not to be a scholarly man. he was more of a sportsman who became a priest, from what I understand. He wasn't the intellectual other priests were, like Pope Benedict XVI.So, while he's a Saint and in Heaven, we can't rightly say he's a great example of what Popes should be. His dedication to the Rosary and love of Christ? Great examples. But he obviously didn't handle the SSPX case well, delegating it to clergy who were Modernists and aligned against the SSPX, specifically, and Tradition, more generally."

1hwzgws,How do you reconcile the Society‚Äôs view on canonizations?,m68aw3t,asimovsdog,5,"The Conciliar Church doesn't want to be infallible anymore since they do not believe that the Church can be infallible. Paul VI did not ""de-canonise"" saints, but he did ""demote"" them and said they were only myths [abc news](https://abcnews.go.com/International/saint-saint-kind-demoted/story?id=23477573). Meaning, according to Paul VI, the Magisterium was not infallible when they canonized St. Ursula or St. Nicholas (and subsequently removed them from the calendar).So, anyone arguing that these new canonizations are infallible and have to be believed: ask them whether St. Ursula was infallibly canonized. If ""yes"", then Paul VIs view is wrong and post-conciliar canonizations can be rejected because the popes didn't believe in the infallibility of the Church, which is a requirement for promulgating an infallible statement. If ""no"", then Paul VI is right and canonizations in general don't carry infallibility because the Church apparently has the power to canonize mythical creatures without background checks."

1hwzb9k,Let‚Äôs be cliche ,m65656n,Duibhlinn,10,"Be careful that you don't generalise your personal experience and apply it to every SSPX community. My own experience with the SSPX has been vastly different from yours. I was raised nominally Novus Ordo but de facto in an atheist household. I was about 17 or 18 before I even found myself to the Novus Ordo, and older still before I first attended an SSPX Mass.The first time that I went to an SSPX Mass in my area everyone was extremely warm, welcoming and kind to me. They noticed that I was new and they invited me to pray the Rosary with them after Mass and come get food with them later on. They even paid for my tab which was beyond generous. The priest as well approached me in the parish hall when everyone was having tea after Mass to introduce himself, very kind French man, and welcome me to the parish. They basically treated me like I was their family despite most of them having only just met me. If you compare that to how welcoming the local diocesan Latin Mass is, by comparison they basically treat new people like contagious lepers.I really can't speak on what SSPX women think of going out with men who weren't raised in an SSPX community since I'm not a woman nor was I raised in an SSPX community. All I can say is that it has been my observation that they are probably going to be more interested in what your behaviour, virtue and beliefs are than necessarily whether you were raised in the Novus Ordo. If I had a daughter raised in a Latin Mass community I would certainly be cautious about her seeing someone who had literally just shown up 5 minutes ago. But you don't stay a new stranger forever. Keep absorbing the traditional faith and you will no longer be an outsider.One thing I will say is that while yes it's good that people pair up and get married, it is my experience that people who come across like they're simply hunting for a girlfriend aren't seen too favourably and that type of behaviour tends to be looked down upon. Just be a normal person, don't be too intense trying to hunt down a girlfriend, and everything will probably be fine. Arseholes are universal, just because someone attends an SSPX Mass doesn't make them immune from sin. You will always encounter people in life who aren't as nice to you as they should be. Don't let it get you down too much. Try to pray for these people to cool their jets as you Americans say."
1hwzb9k,Let‚Äôs be cliche ,m6587cq,Piklikl,10,"I think you need to be a little more clear and a little less cryptic. The only members of the SSPX are priests. The priests administer the sacraments in the same the Church has administered them for centuries, the faithful/laypeople (us) can choose to receive them. It sounds like you're an older male who recently discovered the SSPX and also met a woman there that you might fancy. This woman was then advised by an SSPX priest to be cautious around you? BTW the SSPX always has and probably always will struggle with community (especially in the US). The SSPX is not equipped to manage parishes, and consistently fails to grow and maintain their communities. What's worse is the SSPX leadership will directly intervene and throttle any serious efforts by laypeople to self-organize and create these communities, so you're not alone in taking issue with how the SSPX deals with community."
1hwzb9k,Let‚Äôs be cliche ,m687jw0,No-Test6158,6,"So let me answer your questions in a fairly balanced way.Is there any chance of you being accepted into the community?Of course. But it will take time. We, as Catholics, are quite used to strangers dropping by. Perhaps they are travelling. We don't want to push them if they're just passing through. There is also the curiosity factor with the SSPX (and to an extent, any Traditional Catholic church) - let's be honest, this is a very different style of worship to what most Christians are used to. We don't know if a newcomer is testing the water or has been attending the Traditional Mass elsewhere for decades.So take your time.Now, I'll address the more sensitive part of the question.Is it possible that you will be accepted for a relationship with an existing member of the community?Of course. If new blood doesn't come in, these Traditional families will die out. Already, certainly in the relatively small country I live in, there is a lot of intermixing between a small set of Traditional Catholic families. ***BUT*** - be absolutely sure that this is not your intention.As someone who has been part of Roman Catholic Traditionalism for coming on for 11 years now, I can sniff out someone who is ""hunting"" from miles away. There are a certain *type* of man, who is attracted to the innocence of a woman and the trappings of her traditionalism with nefarious intentions. This can lead to a lot of pain for a lot of people.If the priest has warned someone about you, then someone else will have spoken to them about your behaviour. Be incredibly mindful of your actions and how they can be viewed. If they have spoken out, then they are concerned about the intentions towards someone. I would have a good think about what you might have done. It might be worth having a chat with the priest about how to approach this in a manner that will not lead to anyone getting hurt.Age gap relationships are scarily common in the traditional scene and they often bring other issues with them. The priest is likely acting with the best intentions of both you and the woman involved, looking to steer away from a possible scandal but also trying to make sure that nobody gets hurt.If you are new to the community, I would recommend **NOT** dating anyone until you are stable within the community. You still have a lot of distance to cover to fully understand how the Traditional scene works. I'm only just figuring it out, and I've been part of it for +10 years, and even then, I still don't fully feel like I know what's going on!"
1hwzb9k,Let‚Äôs be cliche ,m65gewr,None,4,"The Society is a fantastic yet strange place sometimes. I was born into it and spent 25 years attending to the last few years in which I haven't been practicing (Nothing to do with it, just the way I've been living)The SSPX community is different in every parish and even in the larger ones here in Australia , you get some really good people and some holier than thou's who have resulted in the loss of some new parishioners. Whilst I can't really grasp entirely at what your reaching out for, I can tell you that in the right parish, people are very welcoming to outsider and even more relaxed in their views (within the trad teachings that is).Over the years, the priests have changed their views on what the recommend for marriage for singles and even so, the varying ideals between priests of different parishes will be quite different sometimes. As for even becoming part of a community especially if your looking for a partner, it doesn't matter what age, if your part of the society or a new comer, its equally as hard as there is people of all ages which are quite liberal that attend the Society and you would't pick them as being a Trad.All in all, the Society is still a reserved way of life that makes people somewhat introverted away from it all due to the constant hate and attack from other Catholic churches but like everywhere you go, there are still welcoming and lovable people, its just a matter of finding where you belong and if marriage is goal, still believing and trusting God will make you find your home."

That's what I've heard from older parishioners, but they don't say this kind of thing in public, they said it to me probably because I have been going to mass one or two times a week for more than a year and I've been helping internally a bit. It seems impossible or at least highly impractical, to be honest. People cant just change careers, we need more than potatoes and eggs. Eveything takes an enormous amount of money, but no one is interested in actually solving a problem and selling the solution. The teenagers i've talked to want to open a virtual library or something like that. They want 0 contact with the world outside the context of religion. The same goes for young adults who still live with their parents. These guys have 0, and I mean 0, common sense outside the church.  No one talking about becoming a pumbler, a welder, opening a repair shop. Nothing that really creates goods and services. I think one of the biggest problems with communities failling to thrive is that most guys are manchildren, at least where I go. They dont talk about money because ""not everything is about money"", but thats easy to say when you live with your parents. They cant talk to a woman even if it costed their lives, and i've even seen my wife's friends complaining about it. The priests also dont talk about it. Theres a gap betweeen the single and the married men. Two completely different types of people, and they dont even talk to each other other than basic small talk."

1hwt66o,A bit confused about supplied jurisdiction,m64ab3y,No-Test6158,4,"Laicisation is almost always automatic. But most cases are heard in Rome. As the SSPX is subject to Rome, if Rome rules that a cleric is laicised, then they are laicised. They may appeal but if they decide to ignore Rome and continue to practice their ministry then they are doing so completely illicitly. Which also hands them over to secular authorities.They may only celebrate a sacrament *""in extremis""* - that is, if there is an immediate risk of death. And I believe this is limited to just hearing confession and giving last rites."

This shouldn‚Äôt be shocking but we don‚Äôt need to affirm all of their views or claims (nor should we) for risk of taking them to be their own magisterium with their own keys. This idea of supplied jurisdiction introduces a totally subjective way of viewing elements of sacramental life that are totally objective.

1hwt66o,A bit confused about supplied jurisdiction,m69zqsx,PhilIntrate,1,"So theoretically, if Rome were to laicize all priests of the society, they could only celebrate ""in extremis"" going forward?"
1hwt66o,A bit confused about supplied jurisdiction,m654dzm,No-Test6158,2,"Good question>Bishops, priests and other ministers of the Church cannot exercise the power they have received in Holy Orders unless authorized and sent to do so by their lawful superiors. The power can never be taken from them, but the right to use it may be withdrawn for causes laid down in the laws of the Church, or for reasons that seem good to those in authority over them.So the SSPX operates under a hierarchy formed of district superiors who answer to the superior general who effectively answers directly to the Pope. So, if the district superior asks something of the priests in his care, they must comply. This goes up across all levels. It also means that the bishops of the society are bound to the superior general, regardless of whether the superior general is a bishop or not."
1hwt66o,A bit confused about supplied jurisdiction,m6a6v0i,No-Test6158,1,"As I said before, laicisation is most often automatic and is incurred when a priest does something that is against their priestly charge or, by their own free will, elects to leave the priesthood. I can't think of any reason why Rome would laicize all priests in the society, or on what charge. If that did happen, I would imagine they would appeal to Rome before they did anything else.The ""in extremis"" case would only apply to those sacraments that need to be administered in an emergency. So there would be no case where they could, for example, say Mass in an emergency - certainly not on the terms that the Society currently practices. It is envisaged purely for those situations where the only member of clergy near to someone who is dying is one that has been laicised. So emergency baptism (which can also be done by a lay person), emergency absolution and emergency last rites.I don't actually know what the penalty is for a priest who continues to minister after they have been laicised. I don't think there is any higher penalty, other than excommunication. I have met a priest who was laicised - he was ordained when he left school and then immediately realised that the clerical life was not for him. He plays the organ now at a Catholic church and has 2 sons."

1hwt66o,A bit confused about supplied jurisdiction,m66dbuh,rathdrummob,1,"You‚Äôre really supposing a lot. Neither the bishops, priests, or the elected superiors of the SSPX hold any standing anywhere in the Catholic Church hierarchy. They only exercise or submit to authority that they assume upon themselves. And as much as they would say that they answer to the pope, it‚Äôs very clear that they only answer when it suits them. The honest answer to OP‚Äôs question is: that if one were to adopt the SSPX justification regarding supplied jurisdiction to administer the sacraments to the faithful within the jurisdiction  or diocese of a lawful Catholic bishop, one would need only to have someone ‚Äúask‚Äù for the sacraments, thus demonstrating ‚Äúemergency‚Äù. So the honest answer is he can do whatever he can justify to himself, since he is his own authority. If he is laicized by the Vatican, then he no longer has the ability to administer sacraments anymore anyway so then he would simply be cosplaying as a priest.

Most people would pass it on the way. Supplied jurisdiction would only apply if that church was not suitable to minister to the congregation."

Our pastor reminded us that SSPX has not rejected the Pope and it is not in schism. He said, go to the most reverent local parish you can find so you can receive the Eucharist. Regularly. He advised us to look on masstimes.com to find a parish with daily Masses and more than once a week Confession and Holy Hour (some, we‚Äôve discovered, only have Confession by appointment). We have taken his advice. Six months ago, we traveled out of state to an SSPX chapel for Sunday Mass. we went over the day before and stayed in a hotel overnight. Even so, it was a long day driving home, after driving the day before.  We did not feel comfortable eating at a restaurant after Mass. We could not eat the hotel ‚Äúfree‚Äù breakfast because there was not enough time between it and Mass.  If we accept the validity of the current Pope, even if we are not comfortable and have concerns about the NO and all the changes it has brought to the church, then, we should be able to go take Communion (on the tongue) at a NO parish when we can‚Äôt go to an SSPX mission. I advise folks in similar situations to look for ‚Äúreverent Catholic Masses‚Äù which tend to be hybrid with a lot of Latin, more silence, more traditional, and beautiful. There are none of those close to us either, but a couple are 2.5 hours away, which is more doable. Not for membership and full participation, but definitely more often than once or twice a year. We feel we were led by God Almighty to be where we are now. We have continued faith there is a reason for it and it will reveal itself its own season."

1hs432s,What if you Can‚Äôt attend the TLM?,m5iar6y,asimovsdog,1,"> The same thing can be applied to an sspx Mass. Yeah but with the difference that the Latin Mass is thousands of years old and definitely Catholic and the NO is 60 years old, already dying out and was signed off by heretics who denied that the Catholic Church is the one and only means of salvation, so it's doubtful whether it was even ""validly"" promulgated (by a council that wasn't a council, behind the back of Paul VI, designed by a bunch of modernist theologians).> Secondly, how exactly is a NO Mass uncatholic? [Here are 62 reasons, written by the priest of the Campos of Brazil](https://archive.is/SQ12D). Short form: It doesn't express the Catholic faith, not even ad orientem and in Latin. All ""offensive"" prayers that can't be prayed by Protestants were taken out and on top it was written by six Protestants. An attendance at a NO is basically a denial of the Catholic faith and a support of an ecumenist ""all faiths are okay"" one. He who doesn't profess the faith by staying silent will not enter heaven.Second, the NO is basically indistinguishable from an Anglican or Lutheran Mass, which, in some cases, have valid Eucharists. But we don't go there because we're Catholic, not Anglican. The NO priests all have to sign that ""Vatican II is okay"", which is a bold lie. We are not supposed to be ""in communion"" with them, support them or pray with them. Even if we are ""excommunicated"" by them, it does nothing for us, because you cannot mock God with legalese. It is only ""Catholic"" in name, but not in faith, it expresses nothing that is uniquely Catholic.[According to Fr. Gregory Hesse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1OlGrTU7s), a renowned canon lawyer, the rite of the NO is not the ""development"" of the Latin Rite, it's such a substantial change that it's effectively a new, schismatic, rite. It leads people away from the faith, because what you practice becomes what you believe, not the other way around.> The Holy Eucharist at a Novus Ordo Mass is somehow not the Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Our Lord?The SSPX doesn't deny that the Eucharist is valid, but that doesn't mean that you can automatically go there. A valid Eucharist doesn't make a valid Catholic Mass. Orthodox have valid Eucharists too, we don't go there. > How is that even remotely possible and how have the gates of hell not prevailed?Mate, please read up on the difference between material and formal heresy. The current pope says that all religions lead to heaven yet we still say that he's the pope, even though that statement is objectively heretical. As long as the pope does not himself believe or know that he is acting agains the Catholic Church, it means he is in material error, but not formally outside the Church (doesn't mean we support what he's doing). The popes since VII did a massive oopsie. A massive one, but that doesn't mean he's not pope anymore, but also doesn't mean we can blindly follow him. I don't know why someone is on the SSPX subreddit but doesn't know the basics about the SSPX stance on Vatican II. Going to Mass is not a commandment, sanctifying the Sunday is. If you cannot go to an SSPX mass it would be better to not go to Mass at all rather than going to a Mass with people who accept the false teachings of VII but celebrate a valid Mass (ICKSP, FSSP, some Eastern Churches too) or be in communion with people who both in doctrine and practice deny the Catholic faith (NO). Because the goal of the Sacrifice of the Mass is to be pleasing to God and such a sacrifice, while ""valid"", cannot be pleasing to God."
1hs432s,What if you Can‚Äôt attend the TLM?,m5kwbjh,Naft_814,2,"I'd argue against the idea that the Novus Ordo is dying out. I've been to many NO parishes in my Diocese and the neighboring Archdiocese and have seen many people (yes, including young people and families) attend. There's also a large and active young adult group in my Diocese. In my time in the sspx I've seen maybe 6 or so adult conversions but have seen many Baptisms listed in various bulletins for the Easter Vigil. We also can't assume that VII or the NO is the reason for a fall in Faith when 1) Africa and Asia are growing despite lacking the TLM and 2) the sexual revolution and rise of atheism in the West. It's not just Catholicism that saw a decrease in the West, protestants had a decline as well, they wouldn't even have been impacted by VII or the NO.I skimmed through the article you linked, interesting how this is noted: ""These 62 reasons have been written by the priests of Campos (Brazil) before they dangerously accepted a canonical recognition by the conciliar Church"" so do these priests even still believe they originally wrote? (not gonna lie, ""conciliar Church"" is just flat out cringe. The ""conciliar Church"" is still the Catholic Church) it reminds me of Fr. Udressy, the former sspx district superior of Germany who left the sspx last year for reconciliation with the Church.The whole 6 protestants argument is a false belief, one that I held myself. The 6 protestants were obsevers and had no part in the composition of the New Missal. In fact Max Thurian converted in and became a priest. Here are some quotes from him prior to his conversion: ‚ÄúI have no difficulty in affirming that in the new Order of the Mass, nothing has been changed with respect to traditional Catholic doctrine concerning the Eucharistic Sacrifice.‚Äù and""Recently a Protestant liturgical commission was given the task of revising the prayers of the Last Supper. It was proposed that they adopt the second Catholic Eucharistic Prayer (inspired by Saint Hippolytus). That proposition was rejected, because the commission considered that the doctrine implied in that prayer did not correspond to the actual common faith of Protestants. . . .the invocation of the Spirit on the bread and wine presupposed Transubstantiation."" Here's another quote related to the protestant liturgical commissionfrom Lutheran scholar Jean Pleyber in 1976: ""As to the matter in question, I have often assisted at Masses celebrated according to the new canon, and each Sunday I have viewed a televised Mass. I have never seen evidence that such Masses deny the sacrificial character of the Eucharist. And when I hear said and when I read that ‚Äúthey have fabricated a Protestant Mass,‚Äù I know only too well that this is not true and that such persons are wide of the mark. I have even asked the priest in my village to forward the new liturgical texts to me, and I am convinced upon reading them that nothing has changed in Catholic Eucharistic doctrine. I believe it is useful to say that the Catholics who speak of a ‚ÄúProtestantized Mass‚Äù are quite ignorant of Protestantism and perhaps of a great deal of Catholicism.""""We are not supposed to be ""in communion"" with them, support them or pray with them."" My guy, that is literally schismatic according to the second part of the canonical definition of schism. You do this again later when talking about the fssp, institute, other Eastern Churches and accusing the NO of denying the Catholic Faith. Its baffling when i hear defenses that the sspx isnt schismatic yet this (as I was already aware of) is the sspx position. It's this kind of attitude that I once held that made me nervous about attending my local diocesan TLM when I left the sspx a little over a year ago and it's absolutely ridiculous.You either a) have never attended a Novus Ordo Mass b) have never paid attention when attending one or c) have unfortunately been exposed to an actual problematic parish (to which I have the utmost sympathy for you if that's the case) the Catholic Faith is literally expressed in the Mass, the True Presence is literally expressed in the Mass, ""Sacrifice"", ""Offering"", and ""Victim"" are explicitly said in the Mass, in fact the GIRM use Sacrifice/Sacrificial 19 times in the introduction alone, when receiving Communion you literally affirm that you believe in the True Presence (protestants accuse us of idol worship for that btw) Fr. Hesse is problematic, I wouldn't be looking towards him for advice on the subject. I find it funny you say that it leads people away from the Faith when ex sspx attendees have a newfound love and devotion to the Faith after leaving the sspx (and other groups) and primarily attend the NO. Meanwhile, the sspx (and other groups) lead people out of the structure of the Church that Christ established and receive illicit and in cases of marriage and confession (except for the sspx after the year of mercy though permissions are needed for marriages) invalid sacraments. But will appeal a false sense of supplied jurisdiction.The sspx position is that the Holy Eucharist is doubtful in the NO. And yes, Eastern Orthodox do have valid sacraments but they're illicit and not in Union with the Church. Same with the sspx, resistance, and other groups. And before you ""the sspx says the Pope's name in the Canon"" 1)Old Catholic groups do as well 2) the sspx priests are suspended from public ministry (besides confession and with permission marriages) they do not have the necessary permissions and supplied jurisdiction does not cover this.So quick correction the actual quote is ""...every religion is a way to arrive at God"", this is still certainly problematic and the Holy Father should clarify what he meant (i have a feeling i know what he was trying to imply but that's a whole different debate) Regardless there's a major difference between Pope Francis making an off the cuff remark and his authentic Magisterium. There's a difference between his off the cuff remark and an ecumenical council that your are required to assent through Faith as a Catholic and a Liturgy that was promulgated by the Church.Dude, I'm well aware of the sspx's position on Vatican II, I was a staunch supporter of the sspx for nearly 20 years. Note, I hate using that online since it just sounds like progressives who say ""I went to Catholic school"" and since you have no idea who i am (or maybe you do, I know a lot of people in the sspx) you can't really verify that. Regardless, I know the sspx's beliefs, I used to share them myself. Certainly, sanctifying Sundays/Holy Days is the Commandment to which the Church declares that to do so is to attend Mass. Otherwise, I could just take the Dimond Brothers position and stay home all the time. The Sacrifice being pleasing to God is also one that's in Communion with the Church, not ones that are parallel altars against the Union of the Church such as the sspx, resistance, old Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, sspv, cmri, and all the other independent groups who have taken it upon themselves to act as the authority of the Church and treat the Church as losing the Faith as every schismatic group has done throughout history"

In the rest of the world it has increased for demographic reasons, but this is hiding the fact that it is decreasing the proportion of presence in most countries, being replaced by evangelism (or even paganism and islam in Africa). Also, there is a global doctrinal collapse, self-considered Catholics believe less and less in Catholic dogmas both in the West and in the rest of the world. The fact that in the West protestantism declined in the same time as Catholicism is not proof that there is no crisis; the main thing trads accused Vatican 2 was to protestantize Catholicism, so it makes sense they'd follow the same trends. Islam is thriving here, and Muslims (in French opinion polls at least) are more and more believing in what islam teaches. Also, as Hillaire belloc explained, heresy is often about adapting to the current ideas, so Catholicism lost his purpose here. There are also many negative trends that were exacerbated after Vatican 2.regarding the ""62 reasons"", I prefer the brief critical exam, actual doctrinal arguments. Accusing someone of not having attended the NO because they disagree with you is very easy. From your arguments I could say you haven't talked to any SSPX priest about that specific issue. ""Sacrifice"" is used indeed, but in ambiguous terms that don't imply that this is the factual renewal of the sacrifice of Christ. Let's continue being specific, real presence is not enough (even Lutheran believe in it), transubstantiation is the full needed doctrine. regarding schism, you need evidence to claim that. However, the right of necessity authorizes priests to celebrate Mass without jurisdictions, so to settle this debate one needs to settle the previous one about the NO.  Also you're pointing at the many different trad groups, but there is way more doctrinal divergence within the NO (from FSSP to gay German priests): the sad truth is, their religious relativism makes them not care about that.Finally the example of Fr. Udressy you gave... You seem to have information that hasn't been released because he hasn't given his reason (most papers say exactly that), my guess is that there isn't any doctrinal reason. But we lose a priest, we gain a bishop... Bishop Strickland has just released a communiqu√© praising archbishop Lefebvre... in the footsteps of bishop Huonder. Personal examples are nothing, my SSPX parish is thriving, the NO parishes in my area are catastrophic, but I'm not generalizing. Sorry if I sound a little bitter (maybe I should spend less time arguing on internet and touch grass haha), I'll compensate by doing my evening praying in you intention!"
1hs432s,What if you Can‚Äôt attend the TLM?,m5mcr6c,asimovsdog,2,"First, I live in Germany. That should answer your question as to why I hate the NO so much. The NO is nothing but a leftist-green political festival at this point, where women lecture about how oppressed they are and how African ""refugees"" are the new Lazarus and we have to take them all in. Occasionally you have fun liturgical abuse like chicken dance mass in Passau. This is the NO here. You cannot convince me that this is ""Catholic"" just because of the label above the door. Yes, there are ""better"" ones, I do not care to hunt. This is the average NO here.Our bishops are so leftist, they're technically even formally in schism after they signed the ""K√∂nigsteiner declaration"" where they flat-out rejected the ""no"" on contraception by Paul VI (and also continued the German Synodal Way, even after multiple ""no""s by Francis, where they discuss fun topics such as female priests, the definition of a woman and whether priests are even necessary). But, according to you, they still have the label ""Catholic"" and that's all that matters for heaven, yes?

Protestants also speak of ""sacrifice"", but they mean something different. They mean ""Sacrifice"" as in ""remembering Christs sacrifice on the Cross"".> My guy, that is literally schismatic according to the second part of the canonical definition of schism. Schism from the modernist Church yes, but who schismed? To schism means to cut oneself off from tradition, now: is ecumenism and religious freedom Catholic teaching because it was promulgated by the ""Catholic"" church? I'll cite Dignitatis humanae ¬ß4: ""Religious communities (note: especially including Islam) also have the right not to be hindered, either by legal measures or by administrative action on the part of government, in the selection, training, appointment, and transferral of their own ministers, in communicating with religious authorities and communities abroad, in erecting buildings for religious purposes, and in the acquisition and use of suitable funds or properties."" - effectively this means, Islam now has the ""right"" to spread their false faith. I ask you: Would you sign this? Is this Catholic teaching, ""validly"" promulgated? If you answer ""yes"", I need a serious, serious explanation, if ""no"", then why do you attend a Mass held by a non-Catholic priest?We are in schism from the conciliar Church, yes, because they no longer teach the Catholic faith, but an ecumenist one. The conciliar Church is only Catholic in that they have a valid hierarchy, but they are all in material, even if not formal, heresy. Some priests even agree with the SSPX but don't have the guts to leave (they're just cowards). Especially under Francis, diocesan priests are a lot more SSPX-phile than you are.I do not want to be in communion with modernists, because in order to get into heaven, the label ""Catholic"" matters less than the faith ""Catholic"". THEY schismed from Tradition at Vatican II, they do not hold the eternal Catholic faith (or else please explain how the freedom to error is suddenly Catholic teaching). They are the ones who introduced never-before held doctrine on religious liberty, with their bastardized Mass (the NO is merely an expression of that faith, that all faiths are welcome and equal), the ""development of doctrine"" (doctrine does not develop as truth does not change), etc. Francis' remark was not ""off the cuff"", he even tripled down on it. It was an expression of that new faith. In any other earlier century he would've been threatened to be killed for being a heretic if he wasn't pope.> The 6 protestants were obsevers and had no part in the composition of the New Missal. They were officially only ""observers"" at the council, yes, but later actively assisted Bugnini and there were a lot of ""talks"" at the dinner tables after the meetings. Paul VI wanted the NO to be easy for Protestants to accept, and invited them to help. To say ""they did nothing"" is disingenuous - then why were they invited in the first place?> the Catholic Faith is literally expressed in the Mass, you literally affirm that you believe in the True Presence(a) No it isn't, only [30% of NO attendees believe in the Real Presence while 99% of TLM attendees do](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/08/05/transubstantiation-eucharist-u-s-catholics/) and (b) I've been to quite a few NOs and don't remember hearing the word sacrifice (I did hear ""offering of gifts"" like in Protestant circles). The NO is so good at teaching transsubstantiation, that 70% lost the faith. Amazing.> In fact the GIRM use Sacrifice/Sacrificial 19 times in the introduction aloneGive me a NO that actually follows the GIRM like Paul VI intended. I'll wait. I, for one, have never even heard the word ""sacrifice"" in an NO.

There are a few people like that and it's mostly redditors for some reason. Haven't met someone IRL like that. My guess is that they have to somehow gaslight themselves that the NO is perfectly fine and there's no problem with Vatican II, so then they double down on being a rabid popesplainer and St. Francis of Rome can do no wrong. They do feel that something is wrong, but they want to be right so they can ignore the problem of global apostasy and try to convince themselves that there's no problem with Vatican II and it can somehow be explained away. Also happens to ""Anglo-Catholics"" a lot who desperately try to reconcile Anglicanism and Catholicism. It's the same reason why hypocrites commit sins but then are driven towards doing more and more good works: because they want to silence their conscience with good works, which tells them that something is wrong, yet they somehow have to justify ignoring it.> (except for the sspx after the year of mercy though permissions are needed for marriages) invalid sacramentsWhile it doesn't matter (the SSPX has jurisdiction just by the fact that 99% of ""Catholics"" signed off on ecumenism and therefore lost the faith, the SSPX has to exist or else the Catholic Faith is lost), the year of mercy got extended indefinitely and hasn't been retracted so far. The SSPX has full jurisdiction from Pope Francis himself and even a popesplainer like you would have to admit that.> Fr. Hesse is problematic, I wouldn't be looking towards him for advice on the subject. Ah yes, just call someone ""problematic"", without addressing his arguments. Classic argumentation.> But will appeal a false sense of supplied jurisdiction.So, you would rather go to a church that teaches ecumenism, but has ""proper jurisdiction"", than go to a Church that does not teach it because it somehow doesn't have jurisdiction? Which one will get people into heaven?> It's this kind of attitude that I once held that made me nervous about attending my local diocesan TLM when I left the sspx a little over a year ago and it's absolutely ridiculous.Sorry to see you leave but I don't get why it's ridiculous to call the NO schismatic? Do you also support going to the newly approved Mayan rite just because the pope said it's okay now (it was ""validly promulgated"" after all)?> an ecumenical council that your are required to assentNo, an ""ecumenical council"" is only believed to be infallible if it: defines doctrine, excommunicates someone or anathematizes. VII didn't do any of that, it's perfectly fine to not accept it. As said by John XXIII himself, it was merely an ""aggiornamento"", an ""updating"" of the faith to the modern world. You are thouroughly confused on what the term ""ecumenical council"" actually means."

From a little encounter with individuals invested in the SSPX in Scotland and Ireland there seems to be a nucleus of faithful whom are vehemently committed to fidelity to God and His Church.  While outside demonic forces and politics from within threaten the growth of the Society, perhaps more magnified than in other areas.  Unfortunately this is not unique for the plight of the Society: often local ordinaries will spitefully block the growth and movement of the Holy Ghost through the fidelity of the faithful adhering to the Society‚Äôs values.  Do we not share the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic faith?  The actions of these self opposing forces engaged in fear, vitriol and envy say that they either A: have no confidence in their custom and are threatened; B: are demonically inclined to oppose a blossoming of the faith within the Trad circles suggesting they have zero confidence in the ‚Äúecumenism‚Äù they preach.

There are a few islands of relative normality but as soon as you step offshore you are met by a hellscape, one created by the total modernist victory that has taken place.One of the main concerns we currently face as a nation is the threat to the continued existence and preservation of our vast physical heritage such as churches. The Jesuits were trying to sell the church currently housing the Latin Mass in Limerick to developers who wanted to turn it into a leisure centre with a swimming pool. The only thing that saved it from that fate was the 2008 economic collapse. The ICKSP bought it when its value was reduced to being basically economically worthless. A lot more could be done, and should be being done, by all of the orders to preserve this rapidly disappearing treasure. Many dioceses are on the verge of large scale selloffs of Church property and demolitions began a few years ago in some dioceses such as Dublin."
1hngzgu,I have a troubling question,m41ztlu,Piklikl,11,"Ask yourself if you suddenly had amnesia and didn't know about any of the world's religions, how would you be able to figure out what religion is the One True Church?    Just go back to your Catechism: the Roman Catholic Church is the only religion that can meet the four criteria that any religion claiming to be the One True Church would need to meet: * **One:** there can be only one! You can't have multiple religions all claiming to be the one true religion (especially since most of them, the Catholic Church included, explicitly say that other religions are false, so not everyone can be right simultaneously). * **Holy**: the entire point of religion is worshipping God, so you absolutely must judge a religion based on how well it does this (so mega churches with their ridiculous over the top theatrical ""worship"" displays are out, also religions that incorporate degenerate activities as part of their ""worship"" - this was more of a problem with paganism).* **Catholic**: this word means universal. God should be worshipped by all people, so any religion that is designed for one demographic to the exclusion of others (eg a specific race or nationality, or a religion mainly for extroverts) can't be the one true religion as everyone should be able to belong to it. * **Apostolic**: by now you will probably have concluded that a religion based on the Abrahamic traditions is the one true religion, and the Roman Catholic Church is the only religion that is based on the Old Testament and then has an unbroken chain of authority going all the way back to its founding by Jesus Christ Himself who fulfilled the prophecies of the Old Testament. Most religions these days are started by random people with no divine mandate that can be found in other texts. Jesus passed on his authority to Peter, the first Pope, who later passed it on to Linus, and so on. The Eastern Orthodox Church used to meet all of the above criteria, but in 1054 they formally split off from Rome and refuse to this day to acknowledge the authority of the Pope, which disqualifies them as being the One True Religion. From there it's pretty simply to realize that while the Roman Catholic Church is the One True Church, there's been a Crisis in the Church since the 60's if not earlier, and the SSPX is the only group within the RCC to acknowledge this openly and publicly and is basically ""frozen in time"" until competent discussion of the huge changes can happen. The men who happen to be in power in the Church refuse to allow any questioning of these huge changes, so until that happens, the SSPX is left in the awkward, lonely, position of  remaining faithful to the traditions of the Church and the highest law of the Church which is the salvation of souls. All the other ""trad"" groups (FSSP, ICK, trad Diocesan) implicitly declare by their actions that obedience to the current administration is more important than the salvation of souls."
1hngzgu,I have a troubling question,m43tchc,SnowWhiteFeather,6,"God created a rational reality.Sentience is a quality that isn't indicated by the material world. Rocks aren't sentient. Atoms aren't sentient. The relationships between atoms aren't going to generate sentience. At no point should sentience rationally emerge according to natural law, which indicates a supernatural law.If you observe human nature with a belief in supernatural law you can learn about good and bad. You can identify the people who best represent good and bad and listen to what they have to say."
1hngzgu,I have a troubling question,m41r6ds,None,8,"That's the fun part: you don't know!Indeed everyone claims to be right. It's hard to know the objective truth! However, truth does exist, so you can confront different opinions and chose the right one.It's good to investigate what others claim, because listening to their arguments will help you understanding your own faith better.Personally I think the debates that matter the most are:- does God exist? (and there are a lot of answers, almost all of the thinkers in history were in the pro side of the argument)- is Catholicism right compared to other religions? (Here the debate is easier in my opinion, other religions have big flaws when you investigate them)- is the SSPX right in the crisis of the Church? (This debate is the most niche of the 3, however after some research it appears obvious to anyone that there was a major quiet doctrinal change in the 60s, and one has to pick between before and after).The fact we're a tiny minority believing in what we believe doesn't matter; 95% of people don't care and do like the world tells them to, 4% follow what's the most convenient for them to believe.Every time I investigated the SSPX's position on a ""controversial"" aspect I ended up agreeing with what the SSPX says, so I have a tendency to trust them.But yes, we shouldn't be afraid of the truth, so don't be a skeptic, but sure try to ask questions and find answers!"
1hngzgu,I have a troubling question,m42czt0,seeking_0333,2,"First, this is an incredibly well thought out and succinct comment. Very good job.As someone who has been discerning the SSPX for about a year (and been to confession at a chapel twice but nothing else), I just don‚Äôt understand the very last part of what you saidFSSP and ICK and diocesan TLM - how are they more concerned with the current administration than the salvation of souls? They seem very much so concerned with the salvation of souls. Though yes they are ‚Äúplaying ball‚Äù but it seems like if Rome brought the hammer down to eliminate the Latin mass, they could just join or re-join the SSPX.In fairness I believe the same argument could be used in reverse (especially after hearing E Michael Jones say he met with one of the SSPX bishops in England begging him to sign the document from Rome, in 2017 or so I believe, and that he wouldn‚Äôt do it) Fellay maybe. He admitted Lefebvre would have signed it! My guess is because of the requirement to be under a local ordinary.Think how many more Catholics would enthusiastically begin attending the SSPX if they were formally brought into the fold.I guess I‚Äôm still a bit apprehensive with the whole thing. Married with five children. Discerning‚Ä¶God love you"
1hngzgu,I have a troubling question,m4pf4ed,Tasty-Ad6800,1,"Those criteria are established by the church claiming to be the one true church. How can you make an argument that stands in its own merits without relying on the authority of the church? In other words, don‚Äôt rely on an argument where the authority is the final burden of proof. After all, the SSPX reject the authority of the church to justify their position, and you should be able to justify the Catholic Church as the one the church without appealing to authority."
1hngzgu,I have a troubling question,m4pei0x,Tasty-Ad6800,0,A truth is eternal. The true church should be eternal as well. To say one must pick the older or newer is absurd and contradicts the true nature of the Church. I will expect you to caveat your response because you must in order to hold to the SSPX position.
1hngzgu,I have a troubling question,m47ca9d,None,2,"I don't believe this was a comment regarding the personal attitude of the FSSP and ICK priests, many of them being holy priests; he simply meant that their community's official position is giving up in front of Rome (since they rather had obedience to Vatican than loyalty to tradition).Indeed, when they're at risk to lose recognition from Rome they're willing to compromise on anything: say the NO, praise it, say Vatican II has no problem, or not say anything about the current issues.Sadly, if Rome canceled them, there's no evidence all of them would join the SSPX, for the same reason they don't join it know.No matter all of the criticism one can do of the SSPX, it does have the best public doctrinal position, the other trad institutes have good things but they're lacking a few key doctrinal things.If an agreement with no doctrinal compromise was found with the Vatican it'd be justice, but it's not as important as traditional doctrine"
1hngzgu,I have a troubling question,m4fzr13,ourladyofcovadonga,1,It was not Abp. Fellay. It was Williamson that EMJ was speaking with. They are friends. And Williamson was removed from the Society so he does not represent the Society.
1hngzgu,I have a troubling question,m4pwh4a,Piklikl,1,"What other criteria would be essential for a One True Church? I urge you and anyone else to share if you find something better, not to prove that I/the Church is right and you shouldn‚Äôt question things, but because we really don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs other criteria out there.I get that it seems tautological/circular reasoning to use the catechism to ‚Äúprove‚Äù that the Catholic Church is indeed the only true religion in the world, but not only is it a fool‚Äôs errand to try and prove such a thing beyond a shadow of a doubt (apologetics has never been the exercise of proving that the Faith is a fact, but simply to demonstrate that it is reasonable of belief), but also it wouldn‚Äôt be sustainable in the long run to expect to use resources ‚Äúoutside‚Äù the Church to prove the Church is real (as eventually everyone must join or perish).I do think the catechism needs better ways of being taught, and I really like the approach of a detective with historical amnesia waking up today and using reason and logic to conclude, without emotional arguments, that the Catholic Church is the one true Church. The 4 Marks of the Church, in my opinion, is just such an exercise, but from a different angle.To my knowledge, the Church has never used her authority to declare herself the one true Church based on the criteria she has set, the 4 Marks of the Church is just part of the Catechism.The SSPX also doesn‚Äôt reject the authority on its own authority, so to speak, but using the authority and teachings of previous Popes (ie ‚ÄúRome isn‚Äôt wrong because the SSPX says it‚Äôs wrong, but because according to previous Popes Rome is wrong‚Äù). "
1hngzgu,I have a troubling question,m4s04p0,None,1,"What do you mean caveat?The true Church will last until Christ comes indeed. It doesn't mean Popes will always be right about everything. That's all the SSPX is saying. Pope Francis is the Pope, but when he says ""I believe Hell is empty"", it is not ""the Church"" saying it.We're not the ones calling the modernist ideas with the Church the ""counciliar Church"", Benedict XVI started it."

1hagerd,Is it a sin to receive communion in the hand when this is the only option given by superiors?,m19w5ly,Duibhlinn,6,"It's important to take into account that we are mandated to receive Holy Communion only at least once per year. There is no mandated need to receive the Eucharist at every Mass. If I am unable to receive on the tongue I don't receive at all. That obligation to receive once per year is also within reason and subject to the possibility that there is a just and reasonable reason why someone cannot fulfil it.If someone is unable to receive on the tongue in their parish then there is no one forcing them to receive on the hand. They only *need* to receive the Eucharist once per year, and it's within the obligation's rules that as they can't do so in their home parish they can reasonably receive on the tongue elsewhere to fulfil the obligation.As for a seminarian example you give, why is that person in a Novus Ordo diocesan seminary to begin with? If someone doesn't want to receive Communion on the hand why in the world are they going through a seminary which will turn them into priests who the Bishop will force to give Communion on the hand to parishioners at every Mass? Even if someone in a Novus Ordo diocesan seminary makes it through without having to receive Communion on the hand they will still be expected to distribute it on the hand. There isn't a single diocese in the world, other than maybe Campos in Brazil which is a completely exceptional and special circumstance, where a diocesan priest won't be forced to give Communion on the hand. In such a hypothetical scenario of that seminarian it would make me question what in the world they are doing in that seminary to begin with, and why they didn't just go to a traditional seminary.I am aware of a small subset of delusional ""traditionalists"" who believe in ""infiltrating"" Novus Ordo seminaries and playing some sort of ""long game"" to get ordained then somehow at some point in the future turn around and if they become a Bishop implement good policies. Complete fantasy. You're there getting a theology lecture from the Novus Ordo trousers wearing cryptolesbian ""nun"" and other sorts of poison blasted at you 24/7 and at the end you will just be relegated to some arctic wasteland in Alaska when they find out that you aren't 150% on board with modernism.

1hagerd,Is it a sin to receive communion in the hand when this is the only option given by superiors?,m254z54,mattdamon992,2,"Receiving Holy Communion in the hand is not sinful when done with the proper dispositions, especially if it is the only option provided by authority. Historically, this practice dates back to the early Church. St. Cyril of Jerusalem (4th century) instructed the faithful to ""make your left hand a throne for the right, as for that which is to receive a King,"" emphasizing profound reverence in this practice. He also spoke of receiving both the Body and Blood of Christ, indicating that communion under both species was common in some early communities.The Eastern Catholic Churches have preserved the practice of receiving Holy Communion in both species for centuries, often using intinction (dipping the consecrated Host into the Precious Blood). While their practices differ slightly from those in the Latin Rite, they illustrate the diversity of legitimate traditions within the Church.In the modern context, the Church has affirmed that receiving in the hand is permissible if done reverently, as outlined in Memoriale Domini and subsequent permissions from the Holy See. These documents stress that reverence for the Eucharist is paramount, regardless of the manner of reception.For a seminarian or parishioner unable to receive on the tongue, their obedience and interior reverence take precedence. The moral responsibility lies with those enforcing the limitation, as long as the recipient approaches with the proper faith and devotion. The Catechism (CCC 1415) reminds us that the state of grace and proper disposition are what truly prepare us for receiving Christ.Thus, while the traditional reception on the tongue has significant value, receiving in the hand can also reflect a deep respect for the Eucharist when approached thoughtfully. It is not sinful when no alternative is available, provided one's heart is properly disposed."

1hagerd,Is it a sin to receive communion in the hand when this is the only option given by superiors?,m1xfcg5,UntoTheAgesOfAges,1,"> These souls need priests. Preferably good priests.This is exactly the point. The reality is that many people in rural areas need strong priests to lead them. Yes, you may be scandalized by some expressions of modernism in your own Diocese, but it seems like you could persevere in the good fight regardless. The call is to love your flock as Christ loves the Church.Make no mistake, I love that more young men are entering traditional seminaries. However, there is somewhat of a bubble effect - people who love the TLM join seminaries that love the TLM to minister to Catholics who love the TLM. There are many NO Catholics who have simply been raised in modernism and do not know any better. These people need to be evangelized by priests who are willing to enter imperfect Dioceses and fight the good fight, bringing reverent liturgy to people to help them *desire* tradition and the TLM.I'm not surprised that you have received comments not favorable to this endeavor, but those are the kind of opinions you'll find in some traditional corners of the internet. A very good priest friend of mine kept his head down in seminary, says the TLM privately when he is assigned to NO-only parishes - but through his preaching he is inspiring a generation of young men and women to desire tradition. If he had gone to a far-off traditional seminary, these parishioners might not have had such truths preached to them.Perhaps you will be ostracized. Perhaps you will be isolated, impaired in your studies, assigned to a parish in the middle of nowhere once you are ordained. The life of a priest is not meant to be a comfy one, it is meant to be a life of sacrifice - an *Alter Chrisus*. Many desire traditional seminaries because they would suffer in their ordinary Diocesan formation, but suffering is a core component of the Christian life. It can be fuel for the fire of your interior life, giving you inner strength to persevere through the tribulations that you will inevitably experience.If you have time, I would check out [this interview](https://youtu.be/o8ubCSJya-A?si=tp1ozosWIGnyXIgr) with Dr. Ed Feser.

1hag4bh,Would it be a problem for a secular priest to keep a financial reserve for emergencies?,m1m18t4,asimovsdog,1,"A bit of a longer answer, but I'm in the same situation (I have two houses that I can rent out and I want to join an SSPX seminary in my 30s, but I still have stuff to do before I can join).I'll explain:> The immediately matters?It depends on the situation, I just wanted to attack the thinking process: by the time you're old, times may be far worse (stock crash, inflation, war, etc. who knows what'll happen until then), the money might be worthless, get lost in the process, etc. And even if the value of the money is retained, maybe by that time, people will be so hardened in their hearts that your money won't reach them, even if you throw more money at the solution. I just wanted to drive home that it's not your money (a little or a lot) saving people, only Gods grace. Plus ""doing charity"" alone is not the end goal of charity (it can reduce suffering, but not eternal).Jesus prefers the 2 cents of the widow to the riches of surplus of a rich man. A $2 pamphlet that saves one soul can get more reward in heaven than rich man that founds an entire university, little money with Gods grace is more effective than a lot of money without grace. On the other hand, he tells us to *be wise and use our money wisely* (parable of the ten talents). Jesus also wanted the rich young man to trust him and immediately follow him (to make him a disciple), however, this was a direct command from God (which is not your case).I would not see it as a ""either or"", you can give some money away right now, some along the way and some later. So for me, I'll rent out the houses as long as possible, but not invest the generated money into stocks, but use it immediately for tasks at hand. That way I'm never really rich (which is tempting me to laziness), can save souls now AND later and have a security in case of unpredictable emergencies (let's say 20 years down the line the SSPX goes woke / modernist and I'll have to leave them behind, something like that). I guess that is a decent tradeoff on ""invest now vs invest along the way vs invest on my deathbed"".Priests in the SSPX do not take vows of poverty (as they're more or less missionary priests) and monks in the medieval era funded themselves with renting their property, as true poverty proved to be hindering to the actual goal of monks: saving souls and focusing on prayer. **Poverty is not a virtue, but a removal of a spiritual obstacle**, i.e. ""not being attached to your money"" is the first goal. But being rich is good for having your hands free for other stuff, it's not bad in itself. So take my example: it's basically the same way as monks funded themselves all throughout the ages.> I personally sought information about entering traditional seminaries and, at least for the reality where I live, being accepted into these seminaries is extremely unlikely, since they are not accepting ""strangers"", but only those boys who grew up in the traditional rite, were altar servers there and so on.Hm yeah, I'm not familiar with FSSP / IBP, etc. I didn't expect them to be this cliquey. I cannot recommend them obviously because as long as they're in the ""official"" Church, they're ""fake traditional"": sure, they have nice Masses, but have to obey a more-or-less modernist pope in order to keep the buildings and joining them doesn't do much for the long game (see the [FSSP Chartres pilgrimage being threatened to be shut down](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/260875/vatican-could-reportedly-restrict-latin-mass-for-chartres-pilgrimage-french-media-claims)).> As for modernism, I think I can receive the teachings there with a presumption of heterodoxy and form myself in parallel.Maybe in a FSSP / ICKSP seminary, but not in a diocesan. Lots of people tell themselves that, lots of people fail. The ""bishops"" are pure leftists or silent weaklings, from what I've heard. I'd really warn you about this: it's more or less putting yourself into an occasion of sin (or in this case, occasion of modernism), you will probably get infected by it (even the SSPX isn't completely free), even if you don't: as soon as you attempt anything trad within a modernist seminary, you'll be not ordained, kicked out or transferred to the diocese of Antarctica and celebrate the Latin Mass for penguins (kidding, but you get the point). > Yes, I will need to be discreet on some topics in the diocesan seminary, but I think it can be opportunities for growth in humility. Well at least here in Germany, the ""bishops"", if they even deserve that title, are pure heretics. Can't speak for Brazil, but I highly doubt you'll learn anything about the actual Catholic faith in a diocesan seminary. Above all you need to save your own soul, so that's why I wouldn't want you to join a Novus Ordo seminary.The best case outcome in a diocesan seminary (if you even make it to ordination without being discovered as an undercover trad and manage to keep your faith) is being someone like Fr. Nix, a ""diocesan hermit"", i.e. monk-ish travel priest with a decent bishop that allows him to celebrate the TLM. Most people I've spoken to say, in Rome nothing will change until the boomers have died out (somewhere between 2040 and 2060, when the Novus Ordo will die from natural causes).> Who knows, by then we won't have Latin Masses in my diocese.Exactly (also why I consider them ""controlled opposition"", because while they do celebrate nice Masses, they do little to get Rome back on track in the long run and without the SSPX existing, they'd be shut down by the pope in a few years time). They basically exist to distract (parishioners and seminarians) from the SSPX and so it's not helping in the long game."

1hag4bh,Would it be a problem for a secular priest to keep a financial reserve for emergencies?,m1rl0cq,asimovsdog,2,"> By yeah you mean that is indeed very unlikely for me to be accepted in the SSPX seminary?The SSPX constantly says they need more priests, not less. So the SSPX seminaries do have free slots, at least here in Germany. If you're not getting into an FSSP seminary, it's at least worth a try to apply at the SSPX. However, they obviously would like to keep their priests after ordination, because the SSPX funds the seminary and they have an anti-modernist oath, which would probably prevent you from switching later to a diocesan seminary. And they relocate their priests often, but maybe you can talk about starting a mission in your diocese (and not have to worry about getting your TLM restricted).>Do you personally know guys who tried to do this and became corrupted?I admit that I know too few diocesan priests to make a judgment, but an SSPX priest told me this: the Church is a hierarchy and there are cases where you have to obey. So, operating within a bad hierarchy to ""subvert it from the inside"" will fail because the people at the top very well know what's going on and are not well-meaning. Traditionally, all attempted subversions were knifed down by the pope, but in this case it sadly happened that they struck the head. So now it is better to take a step aside and let the corrupt hierarchy collapse. Maybe they will let you continue if you're not dangerous enough. But once you start causing trouble (or in the case of your priest, save ""too many"" souls), they will hinder you, censor you, etc. So your goal to save souls is limited from the start. Plus, you're getting a worse formation than at any trad seminary and have to learn to shut up about the scandals in the Church, have to popesplain things, etc.The biggest problem is what you're NOT learning, e.g. you're not learning that certain things are sins, like immodest clothing for example (it's just the first thing I notice in NO masses). So, how do you expect to give souls good advice if you haven't learned to distinguish good from bad? And if you dare to speak up, you'll be censored. You're not learning to be steadfast and have a backbone, you're learning to be a company man. Padre Pio was holy, but not always well liked, but he cared more about saving his flock than being popular. If I was you, I'd be trying to get the best education possible because after ordination you're going to be too busy to teach yourself on the side. Also, your means of communication in seminary will likely be restricted, so the ""learning on the side"" will likely fail.> Despite everything, I see good priests ordained by the diocese (maybe something like 10% of the total?)Yes, but remember: the first soul you need to save is your own and it can be easily lost: if you advise badly, you as the priest will be responsible for the mistakes of your flock. So, if you go into a seminary that has a 90% modernist priests, how high will the chance be that you won't get infected, spread modernism and go to hell for it? I think the advice from your spiritual director is naive.> Are you of the opinion that it would be in any case morally wrong for me to celebrate in the NO?Yes because of what the NO expresses, how it got introduced, the new theology that went alongside it, the prayers that were cut to please Protestants, Orthodox and Jews, etc. etc., even if celebrated reverently. I know these priests are ""good guys"", maybe they are popular (popularity doesn't mean anything, Protestantism is also popular) and certainly well-meaning, but the opposite of good is well-meaning and nice. Bishop Williamson once called it ""the heresy of niceness"" (versus the virtue of steadfastness). I could never do this, I'd see myself as a supporter of the biggest Church crisis today, I mean, why did these souls get lost in the first place: because of the introduction of the NO. It was a disaster and the more I learn about it, the more scandalous it gets, how the NO was pushed from a small group of Rhine theologians, against the will of most bishops at first (they thought Bugnini was nuts, but then later went along because they weren't well organized and didn't expect such massive changes). I just want the NO to die out naturally so that ultimately the TLM can take over and save more souls because one displays the actual Catholic faith and the other is a Lutheran-lite service and is misrepresenting the identity of the Church.TLDR: see if you can get into the SSPX seminary in Argentinia, from what I've heard the SSPX is not full. Lastly: it's better to NOT be a priest than to be a bad one. Better to be on a waiting list for a trad seminary and having to wait a couple years, than to risk being infected and spreading modernism. Ask them to open a mission near you (the SSPX only opens missions where it knows that Catholics are). If you are popular, the money will come automatically, but you won't have to put your own soul at risk. I can only advise you this far, you're going to have to make the choice yourself. God bless you."

1hag4bh,Would it be a problem for a secular priest to keep a financial reserve for emergencies?,m1u225n,None,2,"Thanks for praying as well!My brother and my friend were raised in tradition, my priest friend wasn't, I'm not sure for the Gabonese friend, it's possible je wasn't; I know other examples who weren't either. The fact that most seminarians were raised in tradition isn't because the SSPX only accepts them, it's simply because traditional families are more prone to create children having a traditional vocation !Regarding donors, I think it's the SSPX who finds them, but the seminarians can help. For example, my friend who is in seminary doesn't have a rich family so SSPX donors are paying for him.Regarding being vaccinated against modernism, I don't think it's impossible you go through staying traditional, but I think it's not going to replace a good traditional formation you'd receive in a traditional seminary; also, the SSPX's position is against the New Mass, I personally agree with that, and you'd have to learn to celebrate the New Mass if you went to a NO seminary, I think this is actually the main issue.Regarding being discreet and left in peace, I think it depends what you're willing to say and how ""tolerant"" the seminary is, so it's difficult to give a definite answer; no matter what I don't think it's a very healthy way to spend a few years of formation.Seminary in my opinion is more than a mandatory step to get ordained, it's a complete life formation that should deeply influence the seminarian to make a good priest, so I don't think it's possible to go through it with a mindest going against the modernist teachings in NO seminary, without lacking what a priest would have after going to a trad seminary.Regarding your relationship with your family, the SSPX is not making people cut the bridges with their families! However it's certain that a priest, no matter where he's sent, will have a new state duty, and his parishioners will have to go above his own family. It's really easy to say for me as a layman who isn't entering the seminary, but we have to sacrifice everything for the purity of the faith we transmit to others!I have a grand-uncle who entered the NO seminary with a traditional mindest, but now he's like the average NO priest I know.There is a difference between being conservative and being traditional; being traditional is only accepting what doesn't contradict Tradition, meaning only the TLM and disagree with Vatican II on some issue, and those 2 things are definitely not publically believed in the diocese. Believing that, you won't ever be made bishop or more, meaning you'll always be dependent on people you disagree with on key doctrinal issues. Nobody is useless where he is, but the NO priests who become traditional are alone and persecuted, and man's not made to be alone, priests should have superiors and colleagues having the same traditional faith as them in order to spiritually survive.I have example of good diocesan priests who are doing good where they are, but no example of diocesan priests who are fully traditional and who didn't end up having to give up some of their traditional beliefs.Anyway, I'm sorry of what I say can sound easy to say, harsh and judgmental, this is not my intention, I just think you having the vocation is great, and I wouldn't want a fellow traditionalist ending up stuck without tradition!"

Yes, I am aware of how the New Mass came about, how the intention was to remove the sacrificial character of the rite, etc.But I do not think that a faithful person is sinning by going to the New Mass if it is the only option he has (for me, for example, it is the only option in the entire diocese). The faithful need the Sacraments and many of them would be scandalized to see Catholics not fulfilling the Sunday precept. I think that, if it is a sin, the greatest responsibility lies with Bugnini, with Paul VI, not with a faithful person who has little to do with the decisions of the Church.I look at my diocese (I live in the countryside). We have dozens of diocesan priests and no traditional priests. We have a population that, for the most part, doesn't even know what TLM is.

But this is not about people being from the tradition or not; I know only one person who was refused, and he was SSPX raised.

Whether people would be scandalized or not is not the question I think, but it's how much they're aware of the alternative.IBP etc. couldn't be stabilized here indeed because they need diocese approval; the SSPX doesn't though (which doesn't mean they have bad relations, in some places like my parish in France they have really good relations, in fact the NO parish priest helped us getting our church.You could even been the re-introducer of Tradition in your diocese, which would be a great vocation indeed!>What do you mean by that exactly?

Most of them did that during John Paul II's pontificate though, sometimes with the help with Benedict XVI as a cardinal, but only a few lasted until 2005 when Benedict XVI became pope.There are ""Freedom of religion in ..."" wikipedia articles for most countries, they are interesting to check (although it's depressing to see how recent it all is and how easily it happened)The only ones that did it in agreement with Vatican during Benedict's pontificate were Italy (""In 1984, following a revised accord with the Vatican, Catholicism lost its status as the official religion of the Italian state\[3\] and Italy became a secular state."") and Nicaragua. But as a cardinal he participated in making countries remove Catholicism as their official faith in many countries during John Paul II's pontificate.Sadly, this is coherent from them, since Vatican II's religious freedom implies Catholicism being a state religion is contradictory to religious freedom.This is very sad because it played a big role in dechristianization. When my country, France, separated Church and State in 1905, saint Pius X reacted by publishing ""Vehementer Nos"", an encyclical condemning that... My country has been going downhill since that."

1h471yp,What's the point of doing a vow of obedience to a unknown superior (as in religious orders nowadays)? ,lzwhc9h,None,1,"First, the vow of obedience is primarily to the rule. Those constitutions are supposed to have been approved by the church, which is where they derive their authority, and also where the superior derives their authority to command. (thus the difference between obeying a random person on the street and a superior). The constitution/rule doesn't arbitrarily change, and it's rare any changes do happen. The idea is that obeying the RULE is your fastest way to perfection. Second, the superior isn't allowed to command anything contrary to the rule, or anything sinful. Given that your superior is not commanding contrary to the rule nor commanding sin, your ability to grow in holiness should not be dramatically hindered by an unholy mother superior. If they ARE commanding such things, no one should be entering that community: how on earth could that be a good thing to take a vow to obey a rule if you know you won't be able to obey it in that monastery? Secondly, prudence is a virtue that always needs to be practiced, even those in religious life though it will look different for them. For example, in the Carmelite nuns, before asking permission for some exception, they are supposed to pray and discern whether they really need that exemption. Of course, they could get permission and they would be able to do what they want in obedience, but constantly getting exemptions can negatively impact your own soul. You can't just pawn off all responsibility for your soul onto the superior (although they have a lot of that responsibility): you are still responsible for your own soul. The same goes for someone discerning religious life: the problem of unfaithful monasteries has existed for all time, and in the early church they had to be discerning about what monastery they went to. For someone discerning religious life, prudence would dictate you shouldn't enter a monastery that runs more like a company than a monastery. To your question: Religious life is objectively more perfect (and therefore more meritorious) than secular life. But is it true regardless of the holiness of the superior? I would say usually yes unless they are commanding against the rule or commanding sin. To your last question, no, it would not be a good choice to make that vow of obedience to a lax community. God will always maintain a faithful remnant of those in religious life, leaving us some faithful monasteries to which he wishes to call people, even if other monasteries choose to be unfaithful to their vocation. There will always be a good option."

1h471yp,What's the point of doing a vow of obedience to a unknown superior (as in religious orders nowadays)? ,lzxkmo1,None,1,"Ok, sorry, I deleted my last account because I only made an account to respond to your question. Making another one.For the first, because of a few reasons. One, there's a good chance they aren't living the rule, and there's a good chance the superior commands things against the rule. Two, because according to Alphonsus Rodriguez, an old writer about religious life, one of the chief benefits of religious life is the good example of the other brothers. St Jerome, along with probably hundreds of other saints, praise the value of religious life for the good example you receive. Being deprived of this is no small loss. Third, the whole purpose of religious life is the pursuit of perfection. To not pursue perfection in the religious life is a mortal sin. If they run like a company, they have probably fundamentally forgotten this aim, thus destroying the character of their religious life. That will affect you too, where you will forget the aim of your life. There are other reasons too.Choosing between the secular priesthood or being a priest in a lax monastery, that's a false dichotomy. If you were to force my hand to answer your question, I don't actually know the objectively correct answer, but it's not a decision you should have to make. If you want to be a secular priest, or feel called to that, do that. If not, don't. If you want to be a monk who is a priest, then find the best monastery that you can and go there. Maybe it won't be as fervent as it could be. Maybe there will be issues there. But then trust our Lord that since you sought out the most fervent monastery you could, that it will be fine and you'll be able to reach the highest degree of holiness you are capable of. And don't go trying to enter a lax monastery. Secular priesthood and monastic life are fundamentally different: your objective if you are a priest is to sanctify the church and you are supposed to have already reached a certain degree of perfection. Your objective if you are a religious is to become perfect. Here's some SSPX communities: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSPX-affiliated\_religious\_orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSPX-affiliated_religious_orders)Also, if you are interested in communities that are latin mass but not sspx, then there are the Carmelite Monks in Pennsylvania and Colorado, and there are Benedictine monks of Norcia in Italy. (Well, there's probably a ton abroad if you are willing to learn a new language. In my opinion Italian is one of the easier languages to learn, though. )"
1h471yp,What's the point of doing a vow of obedience to a unknown superior (as in religious orders nowadays)? ,m00p67q,brazilian_investor_,1,"Thanks so much, you're helping me a lot.So the idea is that the rule/constitutions are safe ways to perfection, and by making a vow of following it and entering a Congregation, an environment that will both encourage and obligate you to follow the rule, you'll be following it and, therefore, on the path to perfection. Is it?>Not pursuing perfection in religious life is a mortal sinWhat exactly would ""not pursuing perfection"" consist of?If a religious follows the orders (according to the constitutions) that his superior gives and does not disobey any prescription of the constitutions, would that be enough to not be in sin?>There are other reasons too.Sometimes I fear that, by joining a religious congregation, especially a lax one, I could be putting myself unnecessarily in a vulnerable situation, in which the renunciation of my will, my possessions, the cloistering, the separation from family and friends could complicate rather than help me in my seeking for God. Is this concern legitimate?>If you want to be a secular priest, or feel called to that, do that. If not, don't.I realize that part of me doesn't want to follow a set rule and thinks I know what works best for me. But I don't know if it's my pride or my disordered attachments clouding my judgment or if I don't have the ""fit"" for religious life in the congregations I've known. At the same time, I want to know what the highest path is for me, in which I best serve God and leads me to perfection.To clarify the situation a little. I've always been very inclined to study and contemplation, while I have low physical energy. I see myself as having a phlegmatic-melancholic temperament.In the active life congregations I've known, the intensity of activities, the rigor of physical labor, the lack of moments of rest are things that drain my energy, impacting my commitment to activities (even prayer). Even recreation on Sundays (with games and conversations for long periods of time) tired me out (that's not how I rest, but in my cell studying or reflecting on something).In a monastery with stricter observance, let's say I would go hungry and sleepy, conditions that I know wear me down and take away my desire to even pray. In addition, for example, to not having access to the internet, which for me is a great tool in studying.On the one hand, religious life sometimes seems counterproductive to me, giving up vainly the resources that I have, and that I could be a secular priest and follow the way of life that seems more suitable to me.On the other hand, when I read some of Saint Alphonsus' writings on the merit of works done through obedience consecrated by the vow, I wonder if the most generous choice would not be to enter religious life and embrace these difficulties out of love. In some of these writings, he says that Dositheus (the the disciple of Dorotheos), for having lived under obedience, enjoys greater glory in Heaven than Anthony the Great; and that pious souls in the world sought shelter under the obedience of any religious congregation precisely because they knew that works done through obedience consecrated by vow yield merits of a greater caliber.How do I solve this puzzle, which one is the most generous choice?"
1h471yp,What's the point of doing a vow of obedience to a unknown superior (as in religious orders nowadays)? ,m020593,None,1,"To preface, I am a lay person, who has been discerning religious life and I'm just repeating my own observations, what I've read, what congregations have told me and what priests have told me. I'm not a real authority in any sense. So take what I say with a huge grain of salt.  >What exactly would ""not pursuing perfection"" consist of?Honestly, I don't have an exact definition. I always took it to mean that you should be aiming for and aspiring to perfection in holiness, and backing that up in your actions. Basically don't say ""I'm at x level, and I want to stay there"" or ""I'm at x level, I want to get to y level, and then stop there"" or ""I'm just here to coast and live my life, I'm not going to try to pursue holiness."" But that might not be totally accurate, and you can probably find a religious priest that would give you a better description. It might be the case you're just not supposed to say ""I'm just here to coast and live my life, I'm not going to try to pursue holiness."" I don't know>If a religious follows the orders (according to the constitutions) that his superior gives and does not disobey any prescription of the constitutions, would that be enough to not be in sin?Yes. (I mean, there are a lot of obvious things that are not going to be treated in the constitutions, like don't go rob a bank. Assuming you're not sinning in things not treated in the constitutions.) In fact, what you're describing would bring you to perfection if done perfectly (following the rule)>Sometimes I fear that, by joining a religious congregation, especially a lax one, I could be putting myself unnecessarily in a vulnerable situation, in which the renunciation of my will, my possessions, the cloistering, the separation from family and friends could complicate rather than help me in my seeking for God. Is this concern legitimate?Entering a lax congregation is not just a vulnerable situation, it's a nearly impossible one. To add an additional note: from what I've seen if you go to a monastery that is lax, not only do you risk the things mentioned before, but you'll find yourself in an impoverished formation program. Sometimes in a deformation program, unfortunately. Back years ago they would at least teach you how to live the rule, but nowadays even that's often not happening. For example, you likely will find yourself not even realizing you're not practicing silence, because you've never see someone actually doing it. Plus there's a chance you'll get sent home anyways for trying to live the life differently than everyone else.In regards to entering a good monastery, giving up these things is not going to be harmful or complicate things. There are reasons why you give these things up, and ultimately it is for your own benefit, to grow in holiness. Unless the superior is asking you to renunciation your will to pursue God, these things aren't the things at stake here. >  To clarify the situation a little. I've always been very inclined to study and contemplation, while I have low physical energy. I see myself as having a phlegmatic-melancholic temperament.I've been told by a religious mother superior before (not saying it's true or not) that a phlegmatic temperament is really good for monastic life. >  In the active life congregations I've known, the intensity of activities, the rigor of physical labor, the lack of moments of rest are things that drain my energy, impacting my commitment to activities (even prayer). Even recreation on Sundays (with games and conversations for long periods of time) tired me out (that's not how I rest, but in my cell studying or reflecting on something).I mean, the issue isn't really these things: there are all types of people, including people that feel like this are in any religious congregation. This is my personal experience, which is very limited, but people that I've met who have been happy in active congregations are those who desire the active apostolate, with the exception of a couple who at the very least have a lack of desire for a heavily contemplative life like monastic life but still have a religious calling. While most who are happy in monastic life have a desire for a lot of prayer and separation from the world. But again, I haven't met a ton of people in either situation."

In addition, for example, to not having access to the internet, which for me is a great tool in studying.For the former, you'll be surprised how your body adapts, and what grace will do. Say you enter a Benedictine Monastery, you might be physically exhausted and miserable for the first several months but it will get better as you get in better shape. For the latter, I had the same struggle. I love to study. Trust me, if you find an orthodox monastery that has a good library, you won't be missing out. Heck, you'll be grateful for getting 'the baby without the bathwater"" or basically, all the spiritual benefits of the internet without the other things, like reddit. You could choose to avoid monasteries that have no intellectual life, if that would bother you.>On the one hand, religious life sometimes seems counterproductive to me, giving up vainly the resources that I have, and that I could be a secular priest and follow the way of life that seems more suitable to me.I promise you that it's not counterproductive. These rules of life were originally written by people who were very holy and very wise, who saw the numerous pitfalls and numerous ways people get sidetracked in their pursuit of God. It's like archery: we may be aiming at the target, but the devil only needs to divert our attention slightly off the course in order to get us to not hit the bullseye, and he'll usually do it by a excess, distortion, or absence of something spiritual. There are congregations that have time to study, but it may be less than you're used to. You'll sacrifice some means of pursuing holiness, but you'll be getting drastically more in return. It's like having a personal dietitian/chef plan and cook the perfect healthy and tasty diet for you, and you saying ""yeah but they don't make very many salads, that's going to make me unhealthy."" >On the other hand, when I read some of Saint Alphonsus' writings on the merit of works done through obedience consecrated by the vow, I wonder if the most generous choice would not be to enter religious life and embrace these difficulties out of love.

Some are extremely holy, but some of them it's a sort of ""holiness but only on my terms."" They rather pray than work when work needs to be done, then recreate when they're supposed to pray, then practice penance but only the selective penances they like. Eventually they become people who are so used to doing everything their way without having to deny their will in even the normal everyday things that most laity have to, in their communal relations, that it kind of destroys the point of having become a hermit. The entire reality of religious life or eremitical life is that it's a holocaust offering: a whole burnt offering of yourself. Not having to conform your will to another's (be it a superior's or directly God's in the case of a good hermit) is antithetical to that. Now, when Thomas Aquinas talks about hermits, he brings up an objection about obedience. He replies that since you are supposed to already be perfect before entering upon the eremitical life, having already been tried in monastic life, that those hermits don't need an external practice of obedience to a superior but rather they already have the practice of obedience in readiness of mind. So I don't know what to make of Saint Alphonsus here. But if you go and meet 10 religious in good monasteries, and then 10 hermits, you'll see what he means. Here's the link in the Summa: [https://www.newadvent.org/summa/3188.htm#article8](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/3188.htm#article8)>How do I solve this puzzle, which one is the most generous choice?I think philosophically, entering monastic life in a zealous monastery. In practice, you'll have to figure that out for yourself. You could just go visit a monastery and see how you like it. I've been told you shouldn't get caught up too heavily on what the ""most generous choice"" or highest philosophicaly is in the theoretical, that God actively wills people to all sectors of life to reach the highest degree of perfection there and that you should do what God desires for you as a subject. (Ie think of both Thomas Aquinas and St Alphonsus). Maybe that's modernist, though, I don't know. I honestly don't know of my own accord what the right answer is. I'm not a spiritual director."

My question is whether this still applies to the way the Rules are applied today.Let's take the Rule of Saint Benedict, for example. From what I see, in monastic history, much more than the ""letter"" of the Rule, what was applied was the ""spirit"" of the Rule. Thus, it is difficult to say how much weight the holiness of Saint Benedict has in this way of life.Even the literal application of the Rule seems to me to present some inconsistencies. I know of an austere monastery where they don't eat meat at meals, but they do eat candies at recreation.>I think of this in terms of the hermits that I've met (some of whom actually do have a vow of obedience)It makes sense. Still, St. Alphonsus is quite emphatic about the value of works done out of obedience. At the same time, in a letter to a young man, he recommends being celibate in one's own home rather than entering a lax monastery.>that you should do what God desires for you as a subjectSounds true. Besides the fact that St. Thomas claims that the mixed religious life is the most perfect, we are still within the natural realm, in a certain respect.But what about the secular priesthood?Although its primary purpose is the edification of the Church, St. Thomas teaches, as can be seen in the rite of the Sacrament itself, that Holy Orders confer sanctifying grace.*""Now, just as sanctifying grace is necessary for us to receive the sacraments worthily, so it is necessary for them to be worthily dispensed. Hence, just as sanctifying grace is given through baptism, which makes us capable of receiving the other sacraments, so also through the sacrament of orders, which designates someone as a dispenser of the other sacraments.""*How can we compare, in terms of the sanctification of the individual himself, the contribution of the grace of the Holy Orders and that achieved by a monk who lives his Rule?"

Same with the Rule of St Albert. I am coming up with a guess for how to deal with this, but. I guess I would fall back on just visiting good reputable monasteries and getting a feel for the Benedictine Spirit, and then discern a community based off of how they live that spirit. (for the benedictine example) And focus more on their fervor and having the right priorities. That's my best guess, I don't know if that's a good answer. I probably shouldn't be giving advice considering that you have a spiritual director, so maybe just ignore that.>I know of an austere monastery where they don't eat meat at meals, but they do eat candies at recreation.Lol, as do I. Also a lot of rules, idk about the rule of St Benedict, forbid eating outside of meals, so that would ban something like that. Repeating my weak guess of a response from above, if I went with the spirit of Benedictines, and the spirit of what religious life is about, evaluating the basic things like the austerity, the silence, etc, I would guess that will guard against this. On the converse, there are sometimes things in a rule that you can break without it really being an issue. Like the Carmelite Nuns constitutions have something about keeping all the monastery money in a chest with 3 locks. >How can we compare, in terms of the sanctification of the individual himself, the contribution of the grace of the Holy Orders and that achieved by a monk who lives his Rule?As far as I understand it, the graces of Holy Orders are charismatic gifts, that is ordering towards the sanctification of someone else, though I am sure they sanctify the person. I have no idea, ask a theologian. But to answer your question, most monks are either choir monks who are also priests, or lay brothers who get drastically less time in prayer. So given you choose to be a choir monk, there isn't a real debate here between a monk and a secular priest.>At the same time, in a letter to a young man, he recommends being celibate in one's own home rather than entering a lax monastery.Can you send me that?

They are old, without education, without money, without descendants to care for them.Even Saint Benedict entered a monastery where, later, they tried to poison him.He left.But, if I were a monk in that situation, without money, without communication with the outside world, without support from family and friends, without being able to act against the obedience of the superior, I could not simply leave.Even if I don't die of hunger or anything like that, it seems to me that there is a risk that I could be putting myself in a situation where, instead of being freer to serve God, I would be worried about my relationship with my superior, with my brothers, the future of the community, etc."

For my part, your advices are very welcome.>Can you send me that? That would make me feel a lot better at my current state in life. Lol. Sure. The book I have is in Portuguese, the translation would be like this:*I cannot recommend the conjugal state, because Saint Paul does not recommend it to anyone except in cases of necessity due to habitual incontinence. I do not believe that he is in such a condition.**As regards the secular priestly state, it should be well remembered that the secular priest has the obligations of a priest and the distractions and dangers of the laity; living in the midst of the world he cannot avoid the whirlwind of governing his own household and the complications that will inevitably come to him from relatives; and his soul will never be able to remain free from dangers. He will encounter temptation within his walls, because he cannot prevent women from entering his house, whether relatives, servants, or other strangers. The ideal would be to live in a secluded dwelling and to attend only to divine things. But this condition is very difficult to put into practice. And that is why few priests aspire to perfection in their homes.**Whereas, by entering a monastery where observance reigns, he will be free from the worry of thinking about what to eat and what to wear, because his vocation will provide for all these needs. He will not have relatives there to continually bother him with quarrels and business dealings that will keep him in constant turmoil; there will be no women there who could make him lose his peace of mind; there will be no rumors of the world that would distract him from his prayer and recollection.**I have said so much on purpose, ""observant monastery,"" because if he wants to enter any other monastery where there is no fervor, it is better to stay at home and make every effort there to save his soul in the most perfect way he can. In a monastery where discipline is relaxed, he will be in danger of being lost. Even if he entered such an Institute with the resolution to devote himself to prayer and to think only of God, led astray by the bad examples of his companions, made an object of ridicule, persecuted by those for whom his example is a tacit rebuke, he will abandon all devotions and end up doing as the others do, as experience proves.*But, for that matter, I would check this episode of the SSPX podcast of Vocation Series:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yo\_Ep8V9rQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yo_Ep8V9rQ)  I've liked this content too (in Portuguese):  [https://www.salusincaritate.com/2021/02/consagrados-sobre-o-celibato-leigo.html](https://www.salusincaritate.com/2021/02/consagrados-sobre-o-celibato-leigo.html)  And I was reading the book ""Single for a Greater Purpose: A Hidden Joy in the Catholic Church"".I was considering this option.  But then I thought, why not become a secular priest?I am considering entering the seminary of my diocese.  It is corrupt morally and doctrinally, but my spiritual director said that it would be possible to graduate in parallel and survive during the formation period.  (From what I have been told, here in Brazil it is very difficult to be accepted a man into a traditional seminary who has not grown up in that environment since he was younger - which is not my case, I'm 27)"
1h471yp,What's the point of doing a vow of obedience to a unknown superior (as in religious orders nowadays)? ,m02und9,None,1,"I am really sorry about how that monastery went. So discernment is basically just the use of the virtue of infused prudence (which resides in the intellect) with the aid of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, 4 of which are aimed at the intellect and one of which (counsel) is particular helpful for discernment. The point of these gifts is because we don't have angelic knowledge, we are still able to make foolish decisions even with perfect infused prudence. So God's counsel makes up for our lack in knowledge to help us make good decisions.It's kind of like discerning marriage in this modern era. You could do all the due diligence in the world, marry someone devout from your parish who grew up with your values, get advice from others, pray deeply for God to give you counsel. That woman could still divorce you in 5 years, leaving you with 3 small children. That's a disaster. You can't truly prevent that from happening, and that happened to someone I heard of at my parish. BUT that doesn't mean you choose to not court people ever. You do the best due diligence you can, use your best prudence, pray, etc. And then leave the remaining risk to God's divine providence.All you did in that situation is use your prudence to get out. Also, in those situations where a professed monk is in a monastery with serious issues, they transfer. Those monks who were older probably didn't leave because they're older and change is hard on them (also they might be lax themselves) but what you didn't see while you were there were the monks that transferred out. I entered and left a monastery like you are describing, and later found out about several of the professed having transferred to more fervent monasteries before I entered. I think it's probably easier if you're in a non-SSPX community.Also what I've experienced is that 99% of everyone surrounding any community will tell you that superior is a saint, regardless of that superior's holiness. I don't know why, it's weird."
1h471yp,What's the point of doing a vow of obedience to a unknown superior (as in religious orders nowadays)? ,m031x8p,None,1,"Ok, first that letter by Saint Jerome might be one of the most genius things I have ever read in regards to vocation.My experience is that those who live in an active religious congregation, either they don't have the initial desires for contemplation and higher levels of virtue and pursue it weakly, or they struggle badly trying to balance the two, their pursuit of holiness and active apostolates, that they burn themselves out and eventually become lukewarm. Basically, it becomes a question not of shining vs illuminating, but shining brightly (contemplative) or illuminating weakly (contemplative/active). The second thing to consider is: the secular priest exists to sanctify the church, while the religious seeks to sanctify themselves, BUT in the process of pursuing holiness they strengthen the church.I've never seen secular priests struggle in the same way as contemplative/active religious, but that's probably because I've been surrounded by very holy priests. It's always something I wondered at, that God probably was giving them the grace to become particularly holy despite all their challenges. They seem to have a much healthier contemplative/active balance. Either way, you'd have to ask them about these things.To make things complicated: you could join the fssp seminary in the US? It's probably drastically better than a diocesan seminary, though not SSPX, and I've met FSSP priests who entered that seminary at an older age. You could also just give it a shot at your local traditional seminary: who knows? God might work a miracle. Religious visas are a bit of a mess here, though.It sounds like you just want to be a secular priest. Am I inaccurate in saying that?Also: what I've noticed about lay celibacy is that it tends to be a backup option for people who wanted something else but never managed to make it work. Case in point, there was recently a ceremony in my diocese where 5 women took vows as consecrated virgins. They all had white hair and were very old, which was an odd image considering they were all wearing wedding gowns. I haven't met anyone who actually felt a positive desire for that life. If I were your personal friend or spiritual director, I would advise you to try something else first. I admit to not having read th article or watched the video yet, just giving my fast opinion."

On the other hand, I don't really know what damage a corrupt seminary could cause to my faith.>It sounds like you just want to be a secular priest. Am I inaccurate in saying that?That was the calling that awakened in me last year. It was the most natural thing for me, the reference I had the most contact with, religious life didn't even cross my mind. I only started considering it after realizing that the diocesan seminary wasn't well. The vows of poverty and obedience scared me a little from the beginning. Studying about them, the situation improved. But, as discussed, I see a risk in them, a risk that doesn't seem so small to me. I have tried to base my choice, more than on my feelings, on what would be the highest/most generous state I could choose.This touches on the question, for example, of the merit of works done out of obedience, as Saint Alphonsus puts it. While he himself says that it is not a good idea to enter a lax monastery.Could the explanation be something like this: *""objectively, works done out of obedience consecrated by vow have a higher merit, but taking a vow of obedience under these conditions is unwise""* ?Thinking of an analogy, it would be something like: *""giving alms is meritorious, but for a family man to donate all his wealth is unwise""* or *""fasting is meritorious, but if you are becoming malnourished, it makes no sense""* ?"

When Saint Paul recommends in his letters that it is better not to marry, religious orders like today did not exist.But for men, I personally have come to the conclusion that since the intention is to be celibate in the world, it is difficult not to consider the option of the secular priesthood."
1h471yp,What's the point of doing a vow of obedience to a unknown superior (as in religious orders nowadays)? ,m0499nt,None,1,">Couldn't we also say that the secular priests sanctify themselves in the process of sanctifying the Church?Yes, absolutely!!>You mean in the sense that the life of a secular priest seems less hectic than that of an active life religious?In reality, no, they seem to be busier than active religious and have less time for prayer. They just seem to handle it better and be holier. Maybe that's just my limited experience having been around wonderful priests all the time.Ok, to keep this a little shorter: if I were in your shoes, I would visit monasteries and religious institutes, until I found one that seemed really holy. Sometimes reputation doesn't line up with reality: sometimes there are hidden gems of excellent monasteries, and sometimes a monastery has a great reputation but is lax. I would keep visiting them until I found a good and fervent monastery, so that I'm not going to have this ""what if"" about religious life. (I mean, I wouldn't go on for years visiting these monasteries. But at least make a real effort to find a good one.) I promise you there are good communities out there. Then if I didn't want to go to that monastery, or feel any desire to go to any monastery at all in the theoretical, then I would go to a traditional seminary. I have no intent to contradict your spiritual director about going to the diocesan seminary: I'm just saying what I would do. I would be willing to look outside the country if need be. The second thing I would do in your shoes is I would make sure I was attending daily mass as often as possible, going to confession at least monthly, and praying at least 20-30 minutes a day. The reason for that is because I've met people that get ""roadblocks"" in their discernment due to some worry or hangup about something more human, sometimes even closing themselves off to discernment at all because of that. Having a deep prayer life will help you moderate those human desires and put them secondary to the ""one thing necessary."" I also would try to not get hung up too much on the merit of the vow of obedience, if you really feel called to be a priest: imagine if every priest on the planet did that! That's what I would do in your shoes. I'm also not you, just take all that with a huge grain of salt."

If not for the merit of the vow of obedience, for what reasons I would enter in religious life?I think I have some possible explanations, but need to clarify them a bit."
1h471yp,What's the point of doing a vow of obedience to a unknown superior (as in religious orders nowadays)? ,m04hs2m,brazilian_investor_,1,Could you explain more precisely why it wouldn't sufficient?
1h471yp,What's the point of doing a vow of obedience to a unknown superior (as in religious orders nowadays)? ,m22m47z,None,2,"Sorry for the lack of response: I went on retreat. Here are the reasons I wouldn't go to the diocesan seminary:  One: Aristotle says (I paraprase) that the first requirement for a teacher is that the student trusts/believes in them. (I can't find the actual quote, it's in ""faith, hope and love"" by Joseph Pieper.) This is because what teaching relies on is an act of ""human faith."" That is, outside of a spiritual context, believing some statement on the testimony of another, not because you have actually experienced it or rationally came to that conclusion. If you walk into a store with a blue wall and the shopkeeper says ""hey, don't touch that wall, it was just painted and it's still wet."" You probably wouldn't go and touch the wall to make sure: you believe him on his testimony, and that's what I'm talking about by an act of human faith. By deduction you can see how important this is in the case of education: every single thing you're taught in the classroom is initially accepted on the testimony of the teacher, although hopefully you eventually understand without having to rely on their testimony. It relies not on the actual truth of the statements being taught, but on your trust/belief in the teacher themselves.Imagine spending 7+ years in seminary, going to classes every day where you don't believe your teachers. Where you have to inbibe and remember information that you don't trust is true, and have to recall that information for essays and tests, study it, etc. I'm thinking especially of your biblical studies: you will possibly be taught a lot of things that are objectively false. Imagine being there for 7+ years in a place where you'll be given a spiritual director that you don't trust nor feel secure obeying, a formator you don't trust, etc. That sounds like hell.Two, at the same time you're enduring this environment, you're being deprived of a positive formation. Actual orthodox classes on doctrine, biblical studies, the spiritual life, etc. That is huge: from my experience it seems just not knowing a few basic facts about the spiritual life blocks some people from making progress. Oftentimes in our spiritual life, we'll read a book that didn't have much of an impact at the time, but is extremely helpful to us in 5, 10 years. Reading good books in a good seminary is a huge aid to this. You could respond saying ""yeah but I can read these on my own."" Ok, so you're going to take the time to read 7 years worth of traditional seminary education reading, in addition to your liberal seminary? On number two, it further impacts the quality of priest you'll be. People are spiritually starving. They are thirsting for truth, doctrinally and otherwise. Do you want to be in a position to feed them? Or do you want to be starving yourself? It could be the one writing from a church father that you read in the trad seminary, one word of advice in the seminary, that you put in a homily that changes someone's life. Both your sanctity and that of your flock depend on your formation. Plus there's the sheer fact of the example of good and holy priests in the seminary, which is huge. In my opinion, if you're going to be a priest you minus well be the best one you can be.Third, I don't know if this is a problem in Brazil, but in the USA we used to have problems with seminaries expelling seminarians for being too traditional.Fourth, think of what you'll be doing afterwards. You don't just go to seminary and then do whatever you want afterwards: you're assigned at a parish. It could be a very liberal parish. Even at the most traditional parishes, you'll have to give people communion on the hand. Then you have extraordinary eucharistic ministers, and don't even get me started on the laity bringing communion to the homebound. Of course as you know, at a diocesan parish this will all be in the novus ordo. Remember: Lex orandi lex credenti. If you go to a latin mass seminary, you will end up in a latin mass parish where these abuses are nonexistent.Can you get through seminary unscathed? Sure. Would I personally choose it? No!"

1h2jmw5,Lost In Life and in a Dilema Without Friends,lzkjnxw,Piklikl,9,">to bring someone special into my life to help save my soulThis is problematic. Do not look for anyone else to help get you back on track and save your soul. You need to move from dependence to independence on your own, and only once you're there can you expect a fruitful and flourishing marriage when you establish interdependence with another independent person. It seems like you're trying to move from dependence on a bad lifestyle to distract you from the path you're going down to dependence on another person to drag you up the right path. That's not a recipe for success, and is frankly the wrong move to make as someone who is supposed to be the spiritual leader of your family. Take the list of things you're looking for in a potential spouse and use it instead as a list of things you need to master before you can start looking for a potential spouse. If you're looking for a holy woman, you must first be holy yourself so start taking your faith seriously. Get back to the sacraments, daily rosary, and spiritual reading. If you're looking for a woman who takes care of herself and is fit, attractive, etc, focus on becoming a peak physical specimen yourself. If you're looking for a woman who has her finances in order, work on getting yours cleaned up (use a budget so you can spend less than you earn and invest the difference in low cost, broad based index funds). You want to be the best that you can be for your future wife. You have to take radical responsibility for everything in your life, stop expecting everyone else to pick up your slack. Right now you probably feel like you're standing at the base of a gigantic mountain looking up to the summit that you want to to be at tomorrow, but you have to realize that that would simply be counterproductive. If an angel came and plopped you right at the peak in an instant you not only wouldn't fully appreciate the position, but you're much more likely to fall right off more or less immediately. Beware of unearned rewards/dopamine/money. Resist the urge to ""get rich quick"", both when it comes to money as well as relationships. You're not a good date away from turning everything around (just think about it from her perspective, why would you want your future wife to be saddled with the job of raising a man child?), you are signing up for a lifetime of slow, methodical change. Yes, from time to time it's good to raise your gaze the to the summit to remind yourself of where you're trying to go, but for the most part keep your head down and just focusing on getting through each day and pleasing God. Do not worry about having the strength to stay on the path for the rest of your earthly existence, you just need to get through today. ""Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof"", so you will never be given more than you handle (just be sure that you're always asking God for the graces He is more than happy to give you). Focus on making doing the right thing the easy thing, stop fighting your fallen human nature so much. You say you've moved but now you lack any local religious contact, well maybe it's time to move somewhere where you have more of a local group to immerse yourself in. You're the product of the 5 people you spend the most time around, so stack the deck and make sure they as high quality and holy as possible. You say that the youths you've interacted with just don't seem to be on the same wavelength as you; well, you can either try to find a group that you do vibe with, or you can change your attitude and try to fit in (or exert influence on the group and try to improve their attitudes). The only ""shorcut"" I would advise is develop an attitude of serving others. Stop expecting everyone else to serve you, to have everything taken care of so life is easy for you; instead do everything you can to do this for others. Not only will this help you immensely as a single person (IMO single people have a duty to help society as much as they can), but it will do so much to help prepare you for marriage, which requires daily sacrifice and putting the needs of your spouse and children before your own. Get rid of the alcohol, it does nothing for you, and there is no healthy amount of alcohol you can consume. It trashes your sleep, it hinders your social development, and is overall a terrible waste of money. Foster a habit of reading, as that is the most common habit among successful people. If you don't like reading books, try audiobooks (with the Libby app you can check out audiobooks from your local library for free). Make it non-negotiable, if you don't really like it with enough work you will learn to. For no just focus on making it easy. Start with the book Atomic Habits, as that applies to all parts of your life, especially the spiritual. When it comes to the spiritual, again for now focus on making it easy. Start with fulfilling the bare minimum: attendance at Mass on all Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation. You don't need to be in the state of grace, you just need to go. If you're feeling like you can add in a little more, then just say 3 hail marys right before you go to bed and right when you wake up. The important thing is to start small and only until you've established the habit  can you consider adding more to it. I'll keep you in my prayers."

Lefebvre was regarded as the most important bishop of the 20th Century by Pope Benedict XVI and the early church didnt need Papal approval for Ordinations so its not like lefebvre was doing some terrible never seen before action. There's also the ""the sspx doesnt have canonical status with Rome"" but that can't be backed up, if Rome thought the SSPX wasnt within the Holy Sees communion why then dont they clarify that? The SSPX can also get a bad name for some of its members disrespecting the Holy Father or something along those lines which is some how used against the SSPX itself too. Also the SSPX doesn't absolutely hate the New Order of the Mass, They Hate irreverence in the Mass. The Early seminarians of the SSPX when Lefebvre wasnt present had celebrated the Novus Ordo in Latin. Lefebvre is a hero, and only wanted the Best for the Church. The SSPX accepts Rome, Accepts Pope Francis as the supreme pontiff. Case closed. (Its crazy I went from calling lefebvre heretic to Hero)"

1gub946,Is it wrong to participate in orthodox Christian prayers? ,lxzxebz,asimovsdog,4,"I'll just give you my answer as an anonymous layman:1. They should talk about their differences, first and foremost. At the end, what is at stake is not only the salvation of their own souls but also that of their children. One part goes to Catholic Mass, the other one to a Divine Liturgy - will the children keep the Catholic faith? Likely no.2. Are the convinced Catholics or just Catholic-in-name? If it's the latter it probably doesn't matter, they'll both end up in hell.3. I know this is hard, but: Don't pray with your husband / wife, but pray for him/her (and tell him/her about that). Both the Orthodox and Catholics forbid praying with heretics, so even for the other side you're doing him/her a favor. You can still pray the rosary by yourself without praying with the other person. I know a convert who had a child with an agnostic woman who does this and it works, more or less. They don't pray together and it's not anyones fault, but it's not that much of a problem and they get through the day.If they're converts, then offer up the pain, but if they went into marriage knowingly: every single time it ends up like this, they don't put the faith first, just feelings - only to end up with more pain as the feelings fade. Marriage should not be treated lightly, because the goal of a marriage is to raise children. I myself broke up with someone because she was Protestant and it was clear to me she didn't share my vision of traditionalism. Yeah, she was hot and young and everything, but useless as a potential wife and useless to discuss religion with. It just doesn't work."

The protestant-ish service they do simply doesn't draw anyone to sacrifice their life for it like the TLM does. Why would anyone take up a life of celibacy for this?In Rome, nothing will happen until boomers die out (in about 20 - 30 years). Then, all bets are off. The current pope is a massive boomer, we'll probably get another boomer after him. My guess is that the world will go back to ""normal"" because the economy and the social landscape isn't as good as it was even in the 90s, which makes young people more conservative. The Church will be heavily persecuted by Islamists in Europe, (in 2200, over 50% of Europe will be Islamic, if birthrates stay as they are), it is very much possible that it will go back to normal, but it won't be pretty when it does.

As time goes on and those generations ‚Äúattached‚Äù to the NO die off, there will be a more natural drift back towards the TLM (or parishes like St John Cantius in Chicago).

1gtus6l,Will the novus ordo ever get undone?,ly2exv7,None,2,"Novus Ordo is not the official Mass, it‚Äôs an imposter Mass. It‚Äôs no different to an Anglican Mass. The church is perennial in her teachings and doesn‚Äôt change on the whim of a few corrupt bishops sitting comfortably in Rome, who want to shape and mold the church into their own warped visions.They have the audacity to claim we are the ones not in communion, but it is they who are not in communion. It is them who decided that the church founded by Christ and his disciples is no longer ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù and must be reformed. They are obsessed with legalism in Rome. Shame on them is all I have to say. I pray their hardened hearts change one day, but that isn‚Äôt likely, and the church in Rome seems to be drifting further and further into scandal and disrepair as time goes on. They are bleeding parishioners and closing churches and monasteries because they no longer hold the ancient traditions and integrity that Catholicism was founded on. Most of their priests don‚Äôt even wear the collar anymore. It‚Äôs all so narcissistic and sad to see. Maybe one day it will go back to how it should be, but probably not in my lifetime. They are also losing vocations at an exceedingly high rate."
1gtus6l,Will the novus ordo ever get undone?,lxp7pb0,mattdamon992,-7,"First, let‚Äôs take a step back and consider the big picture. If the Novus Ordo were invalid, heretical, or ‚Äúnot Catholic,‚Äù it would mean that Christ‚Äôs promises to protect His Church have failed. The Church teaches, and always has, that the gates of hell will not prevail (Matthew 16:18). But those promises apply to the visible Catholic Church‚Äîthe Church united under the Pope (currently Francis) and the bishops in communion with him‚Äînot to small, breakaway groups like the SSPX, sedevacantist groups like the SSPV, or Bishop Williamson‚Äôs so-called ‚Äúresistance.‚Äù Christ founded one visible Church, and it is through that Church that He safeguards the sacraments and the liturgy, including the Novus Ordo.The Novus Ordo, promulgated by Pope Paul VI, is the official Mass of the Catholic Church. It is celebrated globally, and while it may feel different from the Tridentine Mass, both forms are valid expressions of the same Catholic faith. To suggest otherwise is to risk undermining the authority of the Church and rejecting her God-given mission to guide the faithful.It‚Äôs important to understand that the Church has always had liturgical development. The Tridentine Mass itself wasn‚Äôt handed down as-is from the Apostles‚Äîit was codified only in the 16th century after the Council of Trent. Before that, there were a variety of rites in use. The Novus Ordo is part of this same tradition of organic development, guided by the authority Christ gave to the Church. Vatican II called for reform, and this is the result. It doesn‚Äôt mean the older form is invalid, but it does mean the Church is exercising her legitimate authority in reforming the liturgy.Now, about the feeling of ‚Äúa different religion‚Äù‚ÄîI understand where you‚Äôre coming from. The externals of the Novus Ordo can sometimes feel less traditional if it‚Äôs not celebrated with reverence or care, but that doesn‚Äôt change the reality of Christ‚Äôs presence in the Eucharist. The same sacrifice of the Mass is offered in both forms. What‚Äôs most important is focusing on Christ in the Eucharist, which is the heart of the Catholic faith, no matter the liturgical form.Finally, regarding why God is ‚Äúletting this happen‚Äù: God permits challenges, even within the Church, to strengthen and purify us. The liturgical debates today call us to deepen our understanding of what it means to be truly Catholic‚Äîobedient to the Church, united with the Pope and bishops, and faithful to Christ. Instead of wishing for the Novus Ordo to disappear, why not work to ensure it‚Äôs celebrated as reverently as possible? That‚Äôs something you can have a real impact on.The Church isn‚Äôt a human invention. She‚Äôs guided by the Holy Spirit, and her liturgy, no matter its form, is always meant to draw us closer to God. Trust in that promise, and remember: the visible Catholic Church is where Christ‚Äôs promises reside."
1gtus6l,Will the novus ordo ever get undone?,lxq5k5t,mattdamon992,-7,"Let‚Äôs dissect your assertions step by step. First, regarding Vatican II as ""an atomic bomb on the Catholic Church,"" even if you stop short of saying it ‚Äúdestroyed‚Äù the Church, you imply significant damage. Such rhetoric conflicts with Christ‚Äôs promises. As Pope Leo XIII reminds us in Satis Cognitum, ""The Church is not something dead; it is the body of Christ endowed with supernatural life."" By its nature and constitution, the Church is both visible and indefectible.Second, your reverence for Archbishop Lefebvre overlooks glaring issues with his actions and theology. He wasn‚Äôt a momentary dissenter; he remained in defiance of lawful authority for over a decade. Pope Leo XIII teaches that ""bishops separated from Peter and his successors lose all jurisdiction."" Lefebvre went further than just disobedience‚Äîhe effectively attempted to redefine Catholicism. By setting up marriage tribunals outside the Church‚Äôs authority, claiming the SSPX now held the marks of the Church, and denying the validity of the Novus Ordo priesthood on the absurd grounds that a priest‚Äôs lack of belief in transubstantiation invalidates the Eucharist, he teetered into theological error and schism. Even more concerning, his view that authority derives from the people‚Äîa Protestant and Gallican notion‚Äîstrikes at the heart of Catholic teaching. St. Cyprian‚Äôs warning is clear: ""Heresies and schisms arise and are begotten from the fact that due obedience is refused to the supreme authority."" Lefebvre exemplifies this, creating division rather than unity. He did incredible work for the church but after Vatican II he appeared to lose faith and seemed to think he needed to save the church even by repeated and significant acts of disobedience, (the end does not justify the means) rather than realising the Church saves us. Third, your fixation on a ""restoration"" of the Church presumes that the Church is not fulfilling her mission. St. Augustine refutes this thinking, declaring, ""The Church will not disappear but shall remain as long as the sun rises and sets."" The Church‚Äôs unity and authority remain in the communion with Peter‚Äôs successor, not with groups or individuals who set themselves up as arbiters of ‚Äútrue‚Äù Catholicism. Maximus the Abbot reminds us that ""obedience to the Roman Pontiff is the proof of true faith and legitimate communion."" The SSPX‚Äôs claim to ‚Äúpreserve tradition‚Äù while remaining outside this communion is incoherent.Lastly, disparaging the Novus Ordo undermines Catholic unity. The Church teaches that all forms of the liturgy promulgated by the Pope are valid and sanctifying. Denigrating it as inferior or damaging is not fidelity‚Äîit is division. The Mass, in any form approved by the Church, is the Holy Sacrifice of Christ. The restoration of the Church begins with fidelity to the Pope and the bishops in communion with him. Pray the Mass, Pray the Rosary, yes‚Äî pray also for the virtues of humility and obedience for us all which are essential to being truly Catholic."

I know the document you're refering to, it was published before VII, and the Pope didn't say ""this has been and will be true of every liturgy ever"": he simply refered to the ones currently proclaimed."
1gtus6l,Will the novus ordo ever get undone?,lxpews3,mattdamon992,-11,"If you think there's 'so much wrong' with my statement, then let‚Äôs actually engage with Church teaching instead of dismissing it outright. The Novus Ordo is a valid, licit liturgy promulgated by the Church under her God-given authority. To deny that is to deny the promises of Christ to His Church. Let me explain why.Christ‚Äôs promises are directed toward the visible Church, not breakaway groups like the SSPX or sedevacantist movements. In Matthew 16:18, Jesus says: 'You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it.' This Church is not an invisible, nebulous group‚Äîit‚Äôs the visible Church united under the Pope and bishops in communion with him.The First Vatican Council affirmed this clearly in Pastor Aeternus: 'The eternal Pastor and Bishop of our souls... willed that in his Church there should be shepherds and teachers until the end of time.' Christ established a tangible, hierarchical Church to safeguard His promises.Pope Pius XII reinforced this in Mystici Corporis Christi: 'They walk in the path of dangerous error who believe that they can accept Christ as the head of the Church, while not adhering loyally to His Vicar on earth.' This makes it clear that rejecting the visible Church or the Pope‚Äôs authority is a rejection of Christ‚Äôs plan for His Church.The Council of Trent also settled any doubts about the Church‚Äôs authority over the liturgy: 'If anyone says that the received and approved rites of the Catholic Church customarily used in the solemn administration of the sacraments may be despised... let him be anathema.' The Novus Ordo, promulgated by Pope Paul VI, is one such approved rite. To question its validity (or to despise it) is to challenge the very authority of the Church established by Christ.So, if you believe my statement is 'ambiguous' or 'untrue,' I challenge you to provide an actual argument, grounded in Church teaching, to support your claim. Engage with any authoritative source, and engage with the clear promises Christ made to His visible Church. Dismissing the Novus Ordo or the authority of the Pope without proper reasoning isn‚Äôt a Catholic position‚Äîit‚Äôs an emotional reaction. Let‚Äôs discuss this like Catholics who seek truth, not like factions that reject it."

1gtus6l,Will the novus ordo ever get undone?,ly42205,mattdamon992,1,"Friend I do actually have real hope that the SSPX will be fully reconciled with holy mother Church next year. I am very hopeful that Pope Francis will allow a consecration and give them a personal prelature. There is so much good the SSPX do but they need to do it within the fullness of the Catholic church. 1. On Indefectibility and the SSPX‚Äôs ClaimsYou argue that the SSPX bishops do not claim jurisdiction and remain in communion with the Church (""not separated from Peter""), but this assertion doesn‚Äôt hold when weighed against authoritative declarations. St. John Paul II, in Ecclesia Dei Afflicta (1988), clearly stated that Archbishop Lefebvre‚Äôs act of consecrating bishops without papal mandate was a schismatic act that resulted in automatic excommunication. Benedict XVI also confirmed in 2009:> ‚ÄúUntil the doctrinal questions are clarified, the Society has no canonical status in the Church, and its ministers ‚Äì even though they have been freed of the ecclesiastical penalty ‚Äì do not legitimately exercise any ministry in the Church.‚ÄùPope Francis was motivated by concerns regarding the lack of valid confessions and marriages within SSPX communities and so granted them faculties in these areas. This was another conciliatory gesture to try and bring the SSPX back into full communion.Supplied JurisdictionThe SSPX‚Äôs invocation of ‚Äúsupplied jurisdiction‚Äù is similarly problematic. Bishop Tissier de Mallerais himself stated:> ‚ÄúIt is inasmuch as you do not refuse to receive from your priests the ministry which they have the right to exercise for your good... that the jurisdiction that you in a certain way give them will be able to be fruitfully exercised.‚ÄùWhile Bishop Tissier qualifies this with ‚Äúin a certain way,‚Äù indicating some level of doubt, this statement reveals a flawed theology of jurisdiction indicating that the people can, by their requests, provide jurisdiction. Lefebvre himself also asserted that SSPX clergy derive their authority from ‚Äúthe requests of the priests and the faithful to take care of their souls.‚Äù Such reasoning directly contradicts canon law and even the SSPX‚Äôs own patron saint, as the Catechism of St. Pius X states:> ‚ÄúThe power possessed by the Hierarchy does not come from the people, and it would be heresy to say it did; it comes solely from God.‚ÄùLefebvre explicitly stated regarding the replacement to Bishop Mayer:> ""This is not the case with the new bishop, who has no other basis for jurisdiction than that which comes from the requests of the priests and the faithful to take care of their souls and those of their children, and who have asked him to accept the episcopacy so as to give them true Catholic priests and the grace of the Sacrament of Confirmation. Thus it is clear that the jurisdiction of the new bishop is not territorial but personal, as becomes also the jurisdiction of the priests.......Since the jurisdiction of the bishop is not territorial but personal and has as its source the duty of the faithful to save their souls, if a group of faithful in the diocese calls upon the bishop to have a priest, this group gives by this very fact, authority to the bishop to watch over the transmission of the Faith and of grace in this group, by the intermediary of the priest that he sent.""(Source: archbishoplefebvre.com)By claiming jurisdiction through the consent of the faithful, the SSPX undermines the Church‚Äôs divinely ordained hierarchical structure. The jurisdiction exercised by bishops and priests must be conferred through the proper channels established and maintained by the Church (the visible, hierarchical body that the world knows as the Catholic Church, headed by Pope Francis, and the bishops in communion with him), not derived from a perceived, and necessarily subjective, ‚Äúnecessity‚Äù or popular demand.Marriage Tribunals and JurisdictionHow can you not see the marriage tribunals as depriving the legitimate successors of the Apostles of their authority to a society of priests with no canonical mission? Lefebvre stated:> ‚ÄúInasmuch as the present Roman authorities are imbued with ecumenism and modernism, and as their decisions and the new laws are in their ensemble influenced by these false principles, it will be necessary to establish substitute authorities to supply for these defects, which authorities will adhere to Catholic principles of Catholic Tradition and of Catholic law. This is the only way to remain faithful to Our Lord Jesus Christ...‚ÄùBishop Tissier also claimed ""true jurisdiction"" for this Canonical Commission, stating:> ‚ÄúThe supplied jurisdiction of the Canonical Commission is not habitual, territorial, or permanent, but personal and dependent on the necessity of the faithful. It is a true jurisdiction, not an exemption from the obligation to receive a judgment from the Church and does not usurp any papal authority or divine right. The judgments and acts of supplied jurisdiction, including the episcopal consecrations of 1988, will eventually have to be confirmed by the Holy See.‚Äù---."
1gtus6l,Will the novus ordo ever get undone?,lya4825,None,2,"Thank you for your detailed answer! It does look chatGPTlike though haha. I'm gonna try to be as synthetic as I can because I don't have much time, but I'll try to answer on everything.I'm also hoping an agreement, not because I think the SSPX is wrong, but because it's not a normal situation indeed that people who openly proclaim non Catholic things (blessing gay couples, religious freedom, ... religious relativism) would be at high positions of the Church while orthodox Catholics are persecuted.Regarding ""being in communion"", this has to be defined first. If being in communion with the Pope means ""agreeing with him doctrinaly"", then the SSPX isn't in communion indeed.  If that means ""to be schismatic"", then it need to be proven that the SSPX is in schism.John Paul II and Benedict XVI might have belived that the SSPX was schismatic and/or excommunicated; they have never formally declared it was that way, and more importantly, **they have never done it infallibly**. You keep using Popes as infallible authority; however, when speaking non infallibly, Popes have been wrong many times in history. Why should we not believe Pope Francis when he preaches religious relativism but we should believe him when he speaks against orthodox Catholics like the SSPX?Regarding jurisdiction, it seems to me you don't see the position of the SSPX as it actually is: they don't say the jurisdiction comes from the people (they would never say such thing), but by the Pope through the case of the necessity (which is brought by the need to give the sacraments to the faithful who are deprived of it, but that doesn't mean the jurisdiction ""come"" from them!Regarding the marriage tribunals it is true you can't trust people who are religious relativists on their judgment for that. The tribunal the SSPX has set up is not claiming jurisdiction or infallibility, but to guide people.Regarding the declaration of Archbishop Lefebvre, how else can you describe the Pope against Tradition in so many essential topics? Religious freedom against Quanta Cura?Archbishop Lefebvre's words here are ambiguous: you could even make them mean sedevacantism. This is not what he defended though. If you read the official SSPX's position, you'll see that indeed that he belived the Pope has materially given up the faith, but he's not saying that the Pope is a formal heretic, nor that he has infallibly declared a heresy. Therefore he didn't deny indefectibility.As a general rule, there is a difference between saying ""I will do this even if you forbid me to do it because you're not fighting for Catholicism anymore but for religious relativism"" and saying ""I consider you don't have authority and I don't want to obey you"". If my father orders me to do something bad, I'll disobey; if he forbids me to something good, I'll do it anyway. That doesn't mean I refuse that he has a right of authority over me nor that I substitue my authority to his.""This claim aligns more with Protestant sectarianism than Catholic unity. Somewhat ironically, the SSPX has splintered into groups like the SSPV and The Resistance, whereas the Catholic Church, despite her suffering, remains the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church united to the Pope and bishops in communion with him.""This is a human argument. Also, first the SSPX doesn't claim to be ""the Church"", and more importantly... The doctrinal divide within the NO Catholics is much bigger than between the SSPX and the resistance; the only difference is we actually care about doctrine, while the Pope doesn't care that he has got bishops publically proclaiming gay/LGBT marriages and religious relativism, and Institute of the Good Shepherd priests claiming Vatican II contradicts Catholic doctrine within the same groups. There is a huge divide within the ex Ecclesia Dei as well: they have to public positions on the NO and Vatican II, but many members basically believe the same thing as the SSPX. Nobody is spared by the crisis of the Church."

Lefebvre‚Äôs Statements and claim the church is in apostasy For example, his infamous 1987 declaration:> ""The proposal of Cardinal Ratzinger...even if you concede to us a bishop, even some autonomy from the bishops, even if you concede us the whole liturgy of 1962, even if you allow us to continue the seminary and the Fraternity as it is working now, we will not collaborate! It is impossible, impossible because we work in a diametrically opposite direction. You [Cardinal Ratzinger and those he represented] work to the de-Christianization of society and the Church and the human person. We work for Christianization. It is illogical. ROME HAS LOST THE FAITH, MY DEAR FRIENDS! ROME IS IN APOSTASY. I do not speak empty words, only that I tell you the truth! Rome is in apostasy. You cannot have confidence in them. ROME HAS LEFT THE CHURCH, THEY HAVE LEFT THE CHURCH, THEY HAVE LEFT THE CHURCH! It is sure, it is certain.""This statement illustrates a complete break from Catholic ecclesiology. Lefebvre‚Äôs claim that ‚ÄúRome‚Äù (the See of Peter) had abandoned the faith effectively positioned himself as the sole arbiter of Catholic tradition, rejecting the papacy and hierarchy.Pope St. Paul VI addressed this type of thinking directly in a 1976 letter to Lefebvre:> ‚ÄúYou refuse to recognize, as must be done, these two ways in which supreme authority is exercised‚Ä¶ In practice, you are claiming that you alone are the judge of what tradition embraces.‚ÄùThe Church‚Äôs indefectibility ensures that the faith will never be entirely lost within her visible structures, as Christ Himself promised in Matthew 16:18. Lefebvre‚Äôs rhetoric denies this indefectibility, implying that the Church‚Äôs marks (One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic) had ‚Äútransferred‚Äù to the SSPX.Lefebvre stated:> ‚ÄúI ask you: where are the true marks of the Church? Are they more in the official Church (I am not talking about the ‚Äòvisible Church,‚Äô I am talking about the ‚Äòofficial Church‚Äô) or in us, in what we represent, what we are?‚ÄùThis claim aligns more with Protestant sectarianism than Catholic unity. Somewhat ironically, the SSPX has splintered into groups like the SSPV and The Resistance, whereas the Catholic Church, despite her suffering, remains the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church united to the Pope and bishops in communion with him.---3. Restoration and the Role of the PopeThe restoration of the Church is always ongoing‚Äîa process of renewal within her visible structures, led by the successors of Peter. Lefebvre‚Äôs assertion that the papacy had become the ‚Äúseat of the Antichrist‚Äù is both theologically unsound and contrary to Christ‚Äôs promises. Pope Paul VI reminded Lefebvre:> ‚ÄúThe mission of discerning and remedying abuses is first of all Ours; it is the mission of all the bishops who work together with Us‚Ä¶ How can you claim to act contrary to the recent Council in opposition to your brethren in the episcopate?‚ÄùThe Pope is the guardian of tradition, not a single bishop or group acting independently. Lefebvre‚Äôs rejection of papal authority led not to restoration but to schism and division. It‚Äôs worth noting that figures like St. Athanasius, who opposed heresy during the Arian crisis, did so in defense of the Church (including the Council which Athanasius defended) and in communion with the papacy‚Äînot in opposition to it. Lefebvre‚Äôs actions lack such fidelity to the Church‚Äôs hierarchical unity.---ConclusionLefebvre‚Äôs actions, while motivated by genuine concern for the Church, ultimately resulted in disobedience, schism, and theological error. The restoration of the Church cannot be achieved through defiance of papal authority or the establishment of parallel structures. True restoration lies in fidelity to the Pope and bishops in communion with him. As Paul VI implored:> ‚ÄúYou break with the Church‚Äôs legitimate pastors and scorn the legitimate exercise of their charge‚Ä¶ You must take the only decision that befits a son of the Church.‚ÄùThe true path to restoration lies in humble submission to the Church‚Äôs hierarchy and trust in the Holy Spirit‚Äînot in setting oneself as the sole arbiter of Tradition"

For example, Bishop Tissier talks about ‚Äúreal jurisdiction‚Äù as I previously pointed out , and Bishop Fellay went so far as to set up a convent in Wanganui NZ under what he called the ‚Äúequivalent of diocesan right.‚Äù There is some info on that here, Our History ‚Äì Dominican Sisters of Wanganui Incorporated ‚Äì The Dominican Sisters of Wanganui Incorporated are separate from, and not associated with, the New Zealand Dominican Sisters Incorporated. That‚Äôs not something you do if you think your jurisdiction is supplied or provisional in nature. There is a sense of a real jurisdiction being imposed. And let‚Äôs not forget the SSPX Canonical Commission - where they require oaths on the Gospels and make people swear not to seek redress from a legitimate Catholic tribunal. A tribunal by its very nature presumes jurisdiction, no? If they didn‚Äôt think they had real jurisdiction, what‚Äôs the point of requiring those oaths? This isn't a small bit of jurisdiction here and there to save a soul in danger of death. The longer this separation goes on, the more it looks and smells like a substitute hierarchy! The SSPX need to come back into regular communion ASAP or it will never happen. On AmbiguityYou acknowledge ambiguity in Lefebvre‚Äôs words - his rhetoric often danced dangerously close to sedevacantism, even if he didn‚Äôt fully go there. Fair enough. But why doesn‚Äôt the SSPX apply the same generous reading to Vatican II or Pope Francis? If Lefebvre‚Äôs ambiguous words can be excused as a reflection of his frustrations with the crisis in the Church, why isn‚Äôt the same courtesy extended to Vatican II interpretation or papal comments today? (There is plenty to be said about Pope Francis and whether off the cuff comments should be considered teachings!)The SSPX seems quick to call out ambiguities in Church documents as evidence to disregard Vatican II or the authority of the Pope (and to refuse the profession of Faith). But when it comes to Lefebvre‚Äôs words - like calling Rome ‚Äúapostate‚Äù or saying ‚ÄúRome has left the Church‚Äù-it‚Äôs somehow not a problem. This double standard undermines their credibility. On Communion and SchismYou argue that being ‚Äúin communion‚Äù doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean agreement with the Pope, but I‚Äôd counter that true communion involves more than just avoiding formal schism. You need actual submission to the legitimate authority of the Pope and bishops. The SSPX‚Äôs refusal to acknowledge this basic principle is what creates the ongoing tension. When you set up tribunals, chapels, schools, and seminaries outside canonical authority and churn out priests that are not sent by ecclesiastical or canonical authority, that looks and functions like a parallel Church, no matter what it‚Äôs called. Similarly when its telling its adherents that all other Latin Masses are bad or questionable (even when in communion with the local bishop), the mass celebrated by 95% of Catholics is 'evil' and that the SSPX has the only legitimate position... The Bigger PictureYou‚Äôre right‚Äîthere‚Äôs a crisis in the Church, and it‚Äôs deeply frustrating to see doctrinal confusion and scandal. But does the solution lie in setting up your own tribunals, declaring the Pope‚Äôs jurisdiction null in practice, and (in effect) claiming a special role as the arbiters of tradition? That‚Äôs a slippery slope. The SSPX often says it‚Äôs not ‚Äúthe Church,‚Äù but its actions often look like a substitute for it, especially when it operates independently of the Pope‚Äôs authority. Like the archbishop, the SSPX seem to see itself as saving the Church, but the Church saves us, not the other way around. I think there's a lot more we could talk about with respect to authority and I'd like to look into your argument on the father scenario. I really don't understand the SSPX position on that myself. It seems they have a bit of a novel way of looking at Obedience - ""If we think what the Church/Pope/Bishops are telling us will mean the destruction of the Faith, then we decline to do it, even if the action of itself is not sinful"". I always understood the Traditional teaching on Obedience is that if you are questioning the prudence of directions, then that is not true obedience! Unless something is clearly sinful, then you should be deferring to Lawful Superiors.  Let‚Äôs not forget that the Church has faced crises before. Is there any real evidence besides the tired argument of St. Athanasius and perhaps Liberius that we can really point to? All the saints I found always just Obey and quietly accept all their trials and injustices (Padre Pio as a recent one).I think there's more I could/should address in your comment, but like you, I am a bit light on time as well tonight."
1gtus6l,Will the novus ordo ever get undone?,lz5jrxt,None,1,"Sorry, I'm answering late again, I'll try to be fast but still answer everything!  JurisdictionTo be honest I'm quite surprised about this debate. I have seen the SSPX accused of many things, but never of believing the jurisdiction comes from the people. If you ask any SSPX priest, they'll tell you they don't believe that.However, it think it's a problem of definition. What does ""coming from"" means? Yes, it is because the faithful need sacraments that the right of necessity exists. It doesn't mean that the jurisdiction comes from the will of the people, and not through the Church, even if people (needing sacraments) is the reason behind jurisdiction. In the letter you're quoting, archbishop Lefebvre says this : ""Since the jurisdictional authority of the bishop \[de Castro Mayer\] does not come from a Roman nomination, but from **the necessity of the salvation of souls**, he will have to exercise it with a special delicacy and taking special account of his presbyteral council."" Indeed, the right of jurisdiction is supplied here by the right of necessity; it doesn't mean it's the people who can grant it. To answer the following paragraph, yes the SSPX imitated the structure of diocese because it's the normal Catholic structure: it doesn't mean they claim the absolute right (as opposed to the necessity right) to create everything, including new dioceses etc. ""A tribunal by its very nature presumes jurisdiction, no?"" It depends what authority is claimed by this tribunal. This tribunal was created because of the abuse in the diocesan tribunals; and the reason they make people swear not to use those is because those tribunals are inflitrated with religious relativism and can't be trusted. That doesn't mean we're claiming jurisdiction!Let's imagine an bad government that would give really unfair justice, condemning innocent people to death and releasing criminals. If a community decided to create its own tribunals, it doesn't mean they contest the right of their government to have tribunals; it means they temporarily need proper justice, and setting up things that could do the closest thing to what those tribunals are doing, without claiming their authority. You seem to be making an Appeal to motive: yes we believe we're compelled by necessity to do those things, it doesn't mean we're claiming this is something else than necessity. Necessity is enough to make us right and to give us the reason we need to do everything to protect the faith.It is not indeed a normal situation: but the modernists who break away from tradition are the ones who caused it, not the SSPX, because the SSPX was compelled by its Catholic duty.On AmbiguityLefebvre is dealing with very complex theological issues, so yes indeed on some quotes you can see ambiguities. But those are always solved by other parts of what he did or said. More importantly, he is never said things that are explicitly going against tradition. Vatican II on the other hand is very ambiguous on some issues indeed, but not only it's explicitly against tradition on some aspects (religious freedom), but also it has been systematically interpreted as such by the post VII Popes. The SSPX doesn't care about Vatican II as such: it's the ideas going against tradition whithin it or behind it that it is afraid of. The fact that all of those following popes and more and more Catholics are believing in these ideas going against tradition are proving us right: the fact people who agree with Archbishop Lefebvre are not infiltrated with those modernist ideas is proving him right as well. ""There is plenty to be said about Pope Francis and whether off the cuff comments should be considered teachings!"" This is the central point: Pope Francis nor Vatican 2 are using infailliblity to claim their contradictory to tradition beliefs: which is why we're not following them. However, some of the things Pope Francis are saying are definitely going against tradition. This doesn't disprove anything against the indefectibility of the Church because he's not saying them infallibly; however, it does mean that he souldn't be followed blindly on everything."

You need to define what you mean by communion and submission. But if by that you mean that we have to agree with everything the Pope is saying infallibly, then of course we do.

Are you obedient if you refuse to participate at your bishop' celebration of LGBT ""marriages"" like they do in Germany?

But all we're doing is clinging to the traditional teaching of the Church, which comes from Christ himself. During the Arian crisis, the majority of bishops were Arian: *The whole world groaned, and was astonished to find itself Arian.* That doesn't mean the bishops who stood up against arianism were wrong!Regarding the NO, most of my family goes to it, it pains me to say it's evil but when you look both at its essence and at its consequences, you can't say it's not evil.

1gtus6l,Will the novus ordo ever get undone?,lzde5fw,mattdamon992,1,"Hi Jackle,**On Jurisdiction**I want to be more direct about the SSPX‚Äôs stance on jurisdiction. You mentioned that the SSPX isn‚Äôt claiming jurisdiction from the people, but only acts out of necessity.  Can you cite cases from history where a bishop or group has ever taken such action and been vindicated? However, the statements from both Archbishop Lefebvre and Bishop Tissier de Mallerais tell a different story anyway if i think. Archbishop Lefebvre‚Äôs 1991 statement regarding Bishop Mayer‚Äôs replacement is very clear:>Additionally, Bishop Tissier explicitly said:>When Bishop Tissier says ""it is a true jurisdiction,"" he isn‚Äôt just talking about some provisional arrangement. He is claiming real, binding authority, even if he tries to frame it as being supplied by necessity (when has this happened and been sanctioned by the Church?). This isn't about guiding people in an advisory capacity; it's about assuming the authority to make binding decisions in a way that directly mimics the canonical jurisdiction that only the Pope and bishops in communion with him legitimately exercise.It‚Äôs quite inconsistent for the SSPX to claim on one hand that they are simply guiding people, while at the same time requiring people to swear on the Gospels and submit to their tribunals in place of the diocesan ones. These actions are fundamentally about exercising authority‚Äîreal jurisdiction‚Äîand not merely offering guidance. This isn't just semantics; it's a matter of how authority is legitimately conferred and exercised within the Church's divinely established hierarchy.The SSPX tribunal, for example, isn‚Äôt merely offering suggestions for dealing with marriage cases; they are making binding judgments that require the faithful to submit, while instructing them not to seek redress from legitimate Catholic tribunals. This isn‚Äôt something that can be done without proper jurisdiction. If they didn‚Äôt think they had legitimate authority, why the oaths? Why the instructions not to appeal to diocesan authorities - or simply just guidance without the rigamole of a 'canonical commission!'. The SSPX's argument that they have the right to do this out of necessity becomes difficult to accept when the language and actions are so clearly about claiming authority that properly belongs to the Church, through the Pope and those in communion with him. To put it bluntly, if it looks like jurisdiction, acts like jurisdiction, and binds like jurisdiction‚Äîthen it *is* jurisdiction. And in this case, it is jurisdiction that hasn't been granted through the appropriate, canonical channels.  You were obviously incorrect to state earlier that   *Regarding the marriage tribunals it is true you can't trust people who are religious relativists on their judgment for that. The tribunal the SSPX has set up is not claiming jurisdiction or infallibility, but to guide people.***Not a Human Institution**You brought up the analogy of setting up a tribunal in a corrupt government to ensure justice. I agree with the general sentiment that, in the face of corruption, there is a need for true justice. However, the Church isn't just a human institution. Christ Himself established the Church, with a visible hierarchy and a divinely guided structure. When we act outside of that structure, we risk undermining not just human authority, but divine authority.The SSPX‚Äôs actions in setting up tribunals, seminaries, and consecrating bishops‚Äîwithout canonical approval‚Äîare actions that mimic the hierarchical authority of the Church. Even if done with the best of intentions, it challenges the very structure that Christ established. The Church has processes for dealing with perceived corruption or error‚Äîthose processes require obedience, patience, and sometimes suffering, as exemplified by saints like Padre Pio. Setting up parallel systems isn‚Äôt the way."
1gtus6l,Will the novus ordo ever get undone?,lz5jv4s,None,1,"The Bigger PictureYes, this crisis is painful and way too long. I'm still hopeful though, change can be unexpected, and some things are going right!Regarding obedience, I think I answered with saint Thomas' quote (he also tackles the question at IIa IIae question 104 article 5) but ultimately for every new crisis there are new dilemnas and theologians haven't answered everything; however I thing that keeping the faith on everything is what matters the most. Reagarding Pope Liberius, he sadly isn't the only example (although it's the most similar one), there is also Pope Formosus, Pope John XXII etc., but more importantly, saint Paul against saint Peter. I think the general rule we need to remember is that being blindly obedient to the Pope is too comfortable to be true, and we need to stand up to evil no matter how much we love and respect the Pope. Padre Pio, who didn't like Vatican II either, was persecuted indeed and accepted that, but he never compromised on faith, and he never said the NO. Besides, he was not a bishop and wasn't a member of the teaching Church, he didn't have the same duties as Lefebvre (who appreciated him a lot).I think this crisis won't solve itself is great saints, as tools of God, don't stand up to it and proclaim Tradition, as they've always done, but it's true that so far we parishoners have been nothing more than sinners, unworthy of fighting for the Church of God. As a conclusion, a passage of saint Augustine that gives me hope: (Of True Religion, VI, 11) ""Often, too, divine providence permits even good men to be driven from the congregation of Christ by the turbulent seditions of carnal men. When for the sake of the peace of the Church they patiently endure that insult or injury, and attempt no novelties in the way of heresy or schism, they will teach men how God is to be served with a true disposition and with great and sincere charity. The intention of such men is to return when the tumult has subsided. But if that is not permitted because the storm continues or because a fiercer one might be stirred up by their return, they hold fast to their purpose to look to the good even of those responsible for the tumults and commotions that drove them out. They form no separate conventicles of their own, but defend to the death and assist by their testimony the faith which they know is preached in the Catholic Church. These the Father who seeth in secret crowns secretly. It appears that this is a rare kind of Christian, but examples are not lacking. Indeed there are more than can be believed. So divine providence uses all kinds of men as examples for the oversight of souls and for the building up of his spiritual people."""
1gtus6l,Will the novus ordo ever get undone?,lzdhfmd,mattdamon992,1,"You mentioned the need to define what is meant by ""communion"" and ""submission."" It involves an actual, lived submission to the Church‚Äôs governing authority, not just in teachings on faith and morals, but in matters of discipline and governance as well. The unity of the Church isn‚Äôt only about shared doctrine‚Äîit also involves visible, structural unity under the legitimate authority established by Christ. I think Communion could be looked into by both of us - how do you see the Church seeing it? I understand, without having a reference at hand, it to mean worshipping with all members of the Catholic Church (and obviously that doesn't mean attending a literal clown or surf mass, nor a LGBT wedding). Specifically, refusing to take communion when attending a NO mass, a FSSP mass etc appears to be a clear 'refusal of communion'. When St. Thomas Aquinas speaks of the duty to resist a prelate in cases where faith is in danger, it is about opposing a specific action that is directly sinful‚Äînot about a wholesale rejection of the prelate‚Äôs authority to govern a group of priests, or establishing parallel structures. I'm not sure about that new advent reference - did you look at the 'reply to objection 2'?# Obedience to Authority vs. Blind ObedienceYou argue that we should not obey the Pope if he asks us to do something against tradition. True, we must never obey a directive that requires us to sin. But what exactly in Vatican II or the Novus Ordo constitutes a command to sin? Disagreeing with certain prudential decisions of the Church‚Äîsuch as the reform of the liturgy‚Äîdoes not justify disobedience. Disobedience is a far cry from raising legitimate concerns in the proper way. The notion that every decision must be examined by each individual Catholic to determine if it aligns with their understanding of tradition places private judgment above Church authority, which is inherently Protestant. The SSPX & Co were not the first to say that the antichrist sits in Rome and had 'lost the faith'. The Church has faced crises in the past, and reform has always been achieved by remaining obedient and suffering in union with the Church, not by setting up independent structures. # ""Parallel Church"" ArgumentYou mentioned that the SSPX doesn‚Äôt want to replace the Pope or create a ""parallel Church"" because Lefebvre didn‚Äôt assign dioceses to his bishops. However, you can‚Äôt deny that the SSPX has, in effect, set up a parallel structure to fulfill roles that belong to the diocesan bishop and the Holy See. The existence of tribunals, seminaries, and the consecration of bishops, all outside of the Pope‚Äôs authority, effectively creates a substitute hierarchy. You may argue that it is out of necessity, but this still amounts to assuming an authority that has not been granted by the legitimate hierarchy.If the SSPX truly recognized the Pope's authority, they would not be establishing their own tribunals,  consecrating bishops, seting up (and taking over!) convents etc, without papal mandate. The fact that Lefebvre didn't assign dioceses is irrelevant if, in practice, these clergy function independently of the Pope and establish their own governance structures.# Critique of the Novus OrdoRegarding your comments on the Novus Ordo, labeling it ""evil"" is a grave statement. This is a liturgy promulgated by the Pope and celebrated across the entire Church. To declare it ""evil"" is to assert that the Church has officially sanctioned something intrinsically harmful to souls, which contradicts Christ‚Äôs promise that the gates of hell would not prevail against His Church (as well as the Council of Trent anathema on this point). How can you really be comfortable stating something so grave when you have the ordinary magisterium and the entire Catholic Church celebrating this mass. If you look at the essence of the Novus Ordo, it is still the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, instituted by Christ. Its validity is not dependent on its perceived alignment with tradition but on the authority of the Church to promulgate liturgical forms. I state again, to claim that the Mass, which the Church has promulgated for the spiritual benefit of her faithful, is evil, is to question the very indefectibility of the Church.# Appealing to HistoryYou mention the Arian crisis and how the majority of bishops were in error at that time. We disagree on the historical facts about what that justified. There are at least two encyclicals from pre Vat II popes that pretty clearly state that Pope Liberious was falsely accused here, and that He **sent** Athanasious out (i.e. jurisdiction) - Principi Apostolorum Petro and Quartus Supra."

You keep making an appeal to motive, but I assure you, if we belived that we'd say it, we're not sedevacantists though, we do believe there is still a Pope, no matter how not Catholic the things he (non infallibly) says are.Tbh this sentence from you seems to be proving my point, yes we act like we have jurisdiction, because we have it through the case of necessity, we're not claiming it comes from somewhere else though.""You were obviously incorrect to state earlier that \[...\]""Well... What part of what I'm saying is ""obviously incorrect""?""The SSPX‚Äôs actions in setting up tribunals, seminaries, and consecrating bishops‚Äîwithout canonical approval‚Äîare actions that mimic the hierarchical authority of the Church. ""There seems to be a misunderstanding; I understand why you'd feel that way, but try to think from the SSPX's perspective: if you disobey orders from the Pope because you considered them bad, and decided to them anyway, how would you do it? The reason the SSPX is following as much as possible the canon law structure is because this is a fundamentally a good law, and because the right of necessity doesn't mean we shouldn't seek having the most normalized canonic status as possible. That's literally the perspective we have, if we believed something else we would say it.  ""The Church has processes for dealing with perceived corruption or error‚Äîthose processes require obedience, patience, and sometimes suffering, as exemplified by saints like Padre Pio.""I already answered about Padre Pio, you didn't answer what I said. Also, Archbishop Lefebvre obviously thought about it since he personaly met him and said Mass for his canonization after his death. Archbishop Lefebvre only waited for having no other option to act. But he did his duty as a bishop, which is to preserve tradition no matter how persecuted he was. The Church needs obedience, patience, but also the virtue of courage (I'm not sure how you call it, in French we call it strenghth). In the extract I gave you from saint Thomas Aquinas, he explains how correcting a superior is a duty and not an act of pride if the faith is at stake."
1gtus6l,Will the novus ordo ever get undone?,lzdm5mp,mattdamon992,1,"I completely agree that keeping the faith is important. But it's crucial to understand what that fully entails in the Catholic context. Remaining Catholic, in the fulsome sense of the word, isn't just about holding on to the teachings that we believe are true and what we believe is Tradition, and attending a beautiful TLM - it means being united to the Church in a holistic manner, through:1. **The Profession of Faith-**this includes adherence to all Catholic doctrines, including those taught by the Magisterium, even if non-infallibly which I think is the sticking point for the SSPX - but lets no go down that rabbit hole of the Profession of Faith and rejection by the SSPX. 2. **Subordination to the Hierarchy-**remaining obedient to the Pope and the bishops in communion with him. I suppose we have argued already about what it means to be 'obedient'. I think we fundamentally disagree. The SSPX say obedience in matters of discpline requires subjective judgement as to whether its a danger to the faith. We won't agree there. 3. **Sacred Communion-**sharing in the sacramental life of the Church, in union with the Church's visible structures. Again, we've discussed this. Without these three bonds, one can't have the fulness of the Catholic faith that Christ intended when He established His Church.# Archbishop Lefebvre and His SuspensionArchbishop Lefebvre‚Äôs actions, particularly after his suspension, present a major challenge in understanding true Catholic unity. Once he was suspended *a divinis*, he lost the ability to legitimately exercise his ministry within the Church. By that time, Lefebvre was already ""retired"" as a diocesan bishop (Remember, he was called out of retirement by a group of seminarians...) - he held no office that would allow him to act independently. Any authority he might have had to govern, ordain, or consecrate came from the Church, not from himself or from the perceived needs of the faithful.When Lefebvre continued to ordain priests and eventually consecrate bishops without papal mandate, he created a schism. We can go down the rabbit hole of the responsibility of bishops in times of crisis, but ultimately, I think it's better to simply look at what Pope St. Paul VI wrote to Archbishop Lefebvre in his 1976 letter. Paul VI appealed to him to remain united to the Church and to trust in the Church‚Äôs guidance. Ultimately, for what its worth (which is nothing), I think he lost faith in the visible Catholic Church, and thought he had to take a whole lot of action to save It (which saves Us). The Pope is not an enemy of Tradition - he is its guardian, and he has the responsibility to guide the Church, even if he does a poor job. # QuotesI appreciate the quote from St. Augustine. It‚Äôs powerful and reminds us that even when good men are unjustly driven out, and attempt no novelties in the way of heresy or schism,their response should not be to form ""separate conventicles of their own."" I'd close my own comment with a couple more. Pope Leo XIIIA*mong the prelates, indeed, one or other there may be affording scope to criticism either in regard to personal conduct or in reference to opinions by him entertained about points of doctrine; but no private person may arrogate to himself the office of judge which Christ our Lord has bestowed on that one alone whom He placed in charge of His lambs and of His sheep. Let every one bear in mind that most wise teaching of Gregory the Great: ""Subjects should be admonished not rashly to judge their prelates, even if they chance to see them acting in a blameworthy manner, lest, justly reproving what is wrong, they be led by pride into greater wrong. They are to be warned against the danger of setting themselves up in audacious opposition to the superiors whose shortcomings they may notice. Should, therefore, the superiors really have committed grievous sins, their inferiors, penetrated with the fear of God, ought not to refuse them respectful submission. The actions of superiors should not be smitten by the sword of the word, even when they are rightly judged to have deserved censure.‚Äù para 37 - Sapientiae Christianae (January 10, 1890) |* Saint Pius X*‚ÄúDo not allow yourselves to be deceived by the cunning statements of those who persistently claim to wish to be with the Church, to love the Church, to fight so that people do not leave Her... But judge them by their works. If they despise the shepherds of the Church and even the Pope, if they attempt all means of evading their authority in order to elude their directives and judgments..., then about which Church do these men mean to speak?

Hence Paul, who was Peter's subject, rebuked him in public, on account of the imminent danger of scandal concerning faith, and, as the gloss of Augustine says on Galatians 2:11, ""Peter gave an example to superiors, that if at any time they should happen to stray from the straight path, they should not disdain to be reproved by their subjects.""""Obedience to Authority vs. Blind Obedience""You argue that we should not obey the Pope if he asks us to do something against tradition.""The SSPX argues for more than that; they're trying to do as Aquinas explains, ""to rebuk him in public, on account of the imminent danger of scandal concerning faith"". It's more than just staying in a corner and disobey anything bad, it's trying to humbly stop our superior the Pope ""straying from the straight path"". ""The notion that every decision must be examined by each individual Catholic to determine if it aligns with their understanding of tradition places private judgment above Church authority, which is inherently Protestant.""Private judgment is about the holy scriptures, not about tradition, protestants don't believe in tradition! But the SSPX is not claiming to be infallible on anything. And us Catholics believe, as Aquinas explains, that prudence should lead obedience. That means we should neither believe blindly everything the Pope says (especially in a time of crisis), nor scrutentize everything the Pope says and try to see heresy in it. Archbishop Lefebvre is everything but the latter."
1gtus6l,Will the novus ordo ever get undone?,lzgh8p3,mattdamon992,1,"The historical record does not provide a precedent for a bishop or group taking such actions‚Äînamely, consecrating bishops AGAINST papal wishes or setting up parallel tribunals‚Äîand being vindicated by the Church.1. Right of Necessity Misapplied: Canon law does reference supplied jurisdiction in cases of necessity, but this is narrowly tailored for extraordinary individual situations (e.g., absolution of a dying penitent by an otherwise unauthorized priest), which, by the way, was a novelty introduced by the 1917 code. It does not authorize systematic, ongoing actions that defy explicit papal directives, as seen with the SSPX consecrations. Canon 1013 explicitly states that no bishop may consecrate another without a papal mandate, and this is a matter of divine law, not merely ecclesiastical law. So invoking a state of necessity to disobey the divine law will not work, as Christ foresees all things. I do have some hope the next consecrations will be given a mandate and that'll be accompanied by a full acceptance by the sspx of the requirements.I've previously replied regarding the people supplying jurisdiction point, but it is still out there that Lefebvre thought the church supplied, through the needs of the faithful, full and personal jurisdiction to essentially wandering clergy, as opposed to following the actual church authority which Christ setup with Peter and the Bishops. 2. Jurisdiction Cannot Be Self-Declared: Archbishop Lefebvre‚Äôs assertion that necessity granted him the authority to act against the Pope's will undermines the Church‚Äôs divine constitution. By the way, doesn't every sede bishop invoke the same state of necessity? Pope Paul VI addressed this directly in his correspondence with Lefebvre, stating, ‚ÄúYou are claiming that you alone are the judge of what tradition embraces.‚Äù The Church alone, through the Pope, determines whether a state of necessity exists.

Once he was suspended*a divinis*, he lost the ability to legitimately exercise his ministry within the Church. By that time, Lefebvre was already ""retired"" as a diocesan bishop (Remember, he was called out of retirement by a group of seminarians...) - he held no office that would allow him to act independently. Any authority he might have had to govern, ordain, or consecrate came from the Church, not from himself or from the perceived needs of the faithful.""Being retired doesn't mean you're not part of the teaching church anymore! For the rest, it comes back to the question I already answered about right of necessity.  ""When Lefebvre continued to ordain priests and eventually consecrate bishops without papal mandate, he created a schism.We can go down the rabbit hole of the responsibility of bishops in times of crisis, but ultimately, I think it's better to simply look at what Pope St. Paul VI wrote to Archbishop Lefebvre in his 1976 letter. Paul VI appealed to him to remain united to the Church and to trust in the Church‚Äôs guidance. Ultimately, for what its worth (which is nothing), I think he lost faith in the visible Catholic Church, and thought he had to take a whole lot of action to save It (which saves Us). The Pope is not an enemy of Tradition - he is its guardian, and he has the responsibility to guide the Church, even if he does a poor job.""If you accuse Lefebvre/the SSPX of schism, the burden of proof is on you, so I'm waiting for arguments. The Pope should not be an enemy of tradition indeed: but that's wishful thinking; what if he is? John XXII was wrong on private judgment, even saint Peter has been wrong on faith matter.An appeal to motive claiming that Archbishop Lefebvre ""lost faith in the visible Catholic Church"" would need more than ""I think"" as an argument!# Quotes""conventicles"" is not defined by a question of number, but by if you're Catholic or notRegarding Pope Leo XIII's, it doesn't contradict what saint Paul, Aquinas and the SSPX have said.Regarding Pius X's, we don't hate the Pope, we pray for him every day, and we don't have judgments, everything we believe about the TLM and religious freedom is based on tradition (e.g. Trent and Quanta Cura)Regarding Padre Pio's... Either he contradicts Aquinas, or you need to be more precise and to define your terms before accusing of schism Catholics who didn't give up an inch of faith standing up to doctrine contradicting tradition and being persecuted for that reason."

Similarly, Canon 751 of the Code of Canon Law defines schism as ""the refusal of submission to the Supreme Pontiff or of communion with the members of the Church subject to him.""Refusing to attend the Novus Ordo, or refusing to participate in it even when fulfilling social obligations, can demonstrate a refusal of communion with the Church. This is especially true when such actions are based on personal or unauthorized critiques, as this places private judgment above the Church's authority. The Novus Ordo was promulgated by Pope Paul VI and affirmed as a valid expression of the Roman Rite by every pope since. To reject it categorically is to adopt a Protestant ecclesiology, where individual or minority group opinions are elevated over the universal teaching authority of the Church.Furthermore, appealing to a ""Brief Critical Examination"" written by an unauthorized body is not a substitute for forming one‚Äôs conscience in line with the Magisterium. The Catholic Church, founded by Christ, possesses the authority to regulate the liturgy, and it is through this authority that the Novus Ordo was promulgated. As Pope Benedict XVI stated, the Novus Ordo and the Tridentine Mass are ""two forms of the same Roman Rite.""To align yourself with the Church, one must submit to her authority and remain in communion with her, rather than fostering division or adopting a cafeteria Catholic mindset. Instead of rejecting the Novus Ordo, the focus should be on ensuring it is celebrated reverently and in line with the Church's teachings. Anything else risks falling into schism and stepping away from the unity Christ willed and mandated for His Church."

1gtklx9,Is it OK to go to a Novus Ordo occasionally?,lxzzezk,Equivalent_Let_2173,2,"It‚Äôs important to clarify the role of the Talmud and its relationship to Christian theology for others reading this. The Talmud is not inspired by God. It is a post-Temple compilation of rabbinic debates and interpretations of the Law of Moses, written centuries after Christ. While it may preserve some elements of earlier Jewish traditions, it does not hold authority for Christians or reflect divine inspiration. Salvation is found solely in the Church, which is the body of Christ.Regarding the phrase ""fruit of the vine,"" it is rooted in Scripture (e.g., Psalm 80:8, Isaiah 5:1-7) and was used by Jesus at the Last Supper, long before the Talmud was written. To suggest the offertory prayer stems from a post-Temple rabbinic tradition seems historically inaccurate unless you can provide actual evidence it came direct from the Talmud. Even then just because it appears there does not mean it is not actually derived from Christ. The Jewish people still hold to the old testament, and so we shouldn't be surprised post Christ Jewish prayers hearken back to the same Old Testament we use. Jesus often used language and imagery from Jewish liturgical and scriptural traditions, but He transformed and fulfilled them in the New Covenant.The Tridentine Mass, like the Novus Ordo, also draws from the Old Testament. This isn‚Äôt a problem but a testament to the Church‚Äôs understanding of salvation history as a unified whole. As St. Augustine beautifully put it, ""The New Testament is hidden in the Old, and the Old is made manifest in the New."" This continuity is part of the Church‚Äôs sacred tradition and its liturgy.The richness of the Mass, whether Novus Ordo or Tridentine, lies in how it manifests Christ‚Äôs sacrifice for our salvation. Both rites, when reverently celebrated, lead us to the same truth: the Cross and Resurrection. Instead of engaging in polemics, we should focus on fostering personal sanctification and unity within the Church. Let‚Äôs keep our eyes on Christ, the source of all salvation, who calls us to worship Him in spirit and truth."
1gtklx9,Is it OK to go to a Novus Ordo occasionally?,ly0ic9g,Equivalent_Let_2173,1,"Your comment raises some interesting points, but it mixes up disciplinary decisions and doctrinal authority, and it seems to miss some key historical and theological context.1. Council of Trent and the Vernacular: The Council of Trent didn‚Äôt ban the vernacular outright. What it actually said (Canon 9 of Session 22) is that it‚Äôs wrong to say the Mass must be celebrated ‚Äúonly in the vernacular,‚Äù which is why Latin remained the standard. But it also allowed for the possibility of vernacular use in some cases, as long as it didn‚Äôt harm unity. The Novus Ordo‚Äôs use of the vernacular fits within the Church‚Äôs authority to make decisions about liturgical discipline and matches Trent‚Äôs emphasis on helping the faithful understand and participate.2. Quo Primum and Liturgical Binding: Saying Quo Primum permanently binds all future Popes is just not correct. Sure, it uses strong language about being ""perpetual,"" but that only applied to its disciplinary rules at the time. Popes can‚Äôt bind their successors in matters of discipline, and history shows this clearly. For example, Pope Pius V used the same ""perpetual"" language in Quod a Vobis about the breviary, but Pope St. Pius X revised it centuries later. The same authority that establishes a liturgical rule can change it.3. Vatican II and the Novus Ordo: The reforms from Vatican II, including the Novus Ordo, were made under the Church‚Äôs legitimate authority. Pope Paul VI promulgated the Novus Ordo as a valid and licit form of the Roman Rite. While it‚Äôs fine to critique how it‚Äôs been implemented‚Äîthings like irreverence or abuses have been acknowledged even by Popes‚Äîthat‚Äôs different from saying the rite itself is invalid or ‚Äúevil.‚Äù That kind of claim undermines the Church‚Äôs indefectibility and authority.4. Liturgical Continuity and Adaptation: The liturgy has always developed over time. The Tridentine Mass itself was a reform of older regional liturgies, not something handed down in its exact form by Christ. The Church has the authority to adapt the liturgy for pastoral needs while preserving its core truths. As Pope Benedict XVI said, the Novus Ordo and the Tridentine Mass are ‚Äútwo forms of the one Roman Rite.‚Äù Dismissing the Novus Ordo because of personal preferences or critiques from outside Church authority misses the point of liturgical development and risks rejecting the authority Christ gave His Church.In short, the Novus Ordo is valid and licit, just as the Tridentine Mass is. Trying to pit them against each other misunderstands how the liturgy has always worked and undermines the Church‚Äôs authority. Rejecting the Novus Ordo because of a misreading of history or authority sounds more like Protestant-style individualism than true Catholicism."

You‚Äôre conflating subjective interpretations of specific actions with objective evaluations of the Church‚Äôs teachings and liturgical rites. The Novus Ordo was promulgated with full papal authority and remains a valid and licit form of the Roman Rite. Isolated events, however controversial, don‚Äôt invalidate what the Church herself authoritatively upholds.Your reference to St. Athanasius is misplaced. Athanasius defended the Council of Nicaea in communion with the papacy, not in rebellion against it. His fight against Arianism wasn‚Äôt an act of rejecting the Church‚Äôs authority‚Äîit was an act of fidelity to it. By contrast, rejecting the Novus Ordo outright or undermining its validity isn‚Äôt fidelity to Tradition; it‚Äôs a rejection of the indefectibility of the Church, which Christ Himself promised.Ultimately, your stance is subjective. You interpret events like a papal gesture and impose your private conclusions on the entire Church and a form of the rite that has been accepted by the entire Roman Catholic church. In contrast, I‚Äôm simply relying on the unbroken tradition of the Church and the authority of the papacy, which Christ established, to demonstrate how Catholics are called to think and act. To reject the Novus Ordo as invalid or evil is to deny the Church‚Äôs authority and indefectibility‚Äîand that‚Äôs a position that no faithful Catholic can hold."

The authority of the Pope in matters of faith and liturgy is clear: ‚ÄúIf anyone says that the Roman Pontiff has only the office of inspection or direction, and not the full and supreme power of jurisdiction over the whole Church... let him be anathema‚Äù (First Vatican Council, Pastor Aeternus, Chapter III) To call the Novus Ordo an 'abuse' is to reject the authority Christ gave to Peter and his successors.

It does not carry magisterial weight and cannot override the Church‚Äôs official stance on the validity and licitness of the Novus Ordo Mass.7.

Such actions and rhetoric are inherently schismatic (refusing communion with those subject to the Pope) dividing Catholics and rejecting the unity of the Church.8. ""Athanasius was defending Nicea: we are defending Quanta Cura, Leo XIII, saint Pius X, Pius XI, and all of the Catholic popes in history who preached against religious freedom and the Protestant meaning of Mass.""Athanasius did so in union with the Pope, not in rebellion. Our task is not to defend prior Popes against the current Pope but to save our own souls. That means remaining in the Church, united with our fellow Catholics, in submission to the lawful Pontiff, as Christ commanded.9. ""He wasn't rejecting the Church's authority indeed: we're not either.""Establishing tribunals, ordaining bishops explicitly against the order of the pope, ordaining priests and sending them into dioceses against the will of the actual shepherds, and rejecting lawful suppression of an order contradicts the claim of obedience. 10. ""We are, as he did, repeating Traditional doctrine even when condemned by the Pope (as he was condemned by pope Liberius).""I recommend checking your sources. Pope Liberius confirmed the Nicene Faith in a council and died in exile for the Faith. Pope Liberius allegedly excommunicated Athanasios but this was undoubtedly forced from him, and Athanasios knew as much. Is your argument that Lefebvre and co believe that the Pope has been pressured into suppressing the sspx?11. ""Saint Paul had a doctrinal disagreement with Peter and he ended up being right.""Paul was also an infallible apostle with miracles and divine mission. The disagreement was about personal conduct, not doctrine or governance.12.

Tradition is not a weapon we wield to challenge the magisterium; it is safeguarded and authentically interpreted by the magisterium. Rejecting the magisterium or refusing communion with the lawful Pontiff (or those subject to him) on claims of ‚Äúbeing faithful to God‚Äù risks repeating the errors of Protestantism: private interpretation over submission to Christ‚Äôs Church. We are not called to stand in judgment of Popes or the Church. Rather, we are called to work out our salvation in humility, within the Church Christ founded, which remains united under Peter and his successors. Obedience and unity‚Äînot rebellion‚Äîare marks of fidelity to Christ."

""True, but the gesture doesn‚Äôt bear doctrinal weight or redefine Church teaching.""I'm sorry but I don't understand how someone can, out good faith, claim that. The Quran is evil. Kissing an object is a sign of complete respect. How can you not make the link? There plenty scandalous acts that any Catholic in all of history would have reproved. Can you imagine how Catholics of all times in history would react to such a thing? Especially the martyrs of Islam or paganism who died rather that paying respect to those evil false religions. I'm honestly shocked Catholics who aren't religious relativists would still try to defend such a deed.There are so many wrong things he did though, like naming cardinal Yves Congar who was condemned by the Holy office (and who admited he peed twice on the door of the Holy Office after his condemnation).2. ""Your/sspx judgment that the Novus Ordo is ‚Äúhalf Protestant‚Äù is necessarily subjective. Validity and licitness of the liturgy are determined by the magisterium, not personal opinion.""Again, we're not contesting its validity but its legitimacy. And when has the magisterium infallibly proclaimed the NO was not valid? A theological opinion that doesn't contradict tradition (=saying the NO has been protestantized) is not de facto uncatholic. However, a theological opinion contradicting tradition (=saying that the NO, even if it doesn't reflect the Catholic sense of Mass, which is the renewal of the sacrifice of Christ, as demonstrated by the Brief Critical Exam) is materially heretical, even if it's not formally heretical.""You can tell a tree by its fruit"". A Pope makes a new ordo which underminds the sense of sacrifice of Christ in Mass. Some Catholics say this will diminish the belief in the sense of sacrifice of Christ in Mass. Practicing Catholics start to massively lose faith in the sense of sacrifice in the Mass (as polls show). Maybe I would't have agreed with the SSPX if I hadn't been born late enough to see their doctrinal analysis proven right.3. Regardless of personal views on individual Popes, their promulgation of the Mass carries the full weight of papal authority.This promulgation is not infallible. Or maybe saint Peter's wrong opinion about Christian views on the Old Covenant was right, even if he ended up retracting it after saint Paul corrected him? ""But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God‚Äôs anathema!"" as saint Paul said. *Again, you seem to confuse ""subjective"" with not infallible.*4. ""Despite poor decisions by some Popes, Catholics are not free to judge them. We are called to respect and obey their authority in all legitimate areas as successors of Peter.""Did saint Paul judge saint Peter? Did Athanasius judge Pope Liberius? St Thomas Aquinas explains it here: [https://www.newadvent.org/summa/3033.htm#article4](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/3033.htm#article4)It is a right, a duty and and an act of charity to publicaly correct a superior when it's a doctrinal issue, even if he's a Pope, or even saint Peter himself.5. That action occurred under a subsequent Pope, after Formosus's death. A future Pope may evaluate and accuse a predecessor, but as faithful Catholics, we are not authorized to pass judgment on a reigning Pope.I didn't say I had the authority to make a trial against a Pope: I said that when a Pope says things going against Tradition, it's our duty to say it.6. answered in 3.

Establishing tribunals, \[...\] contradicts the claim of obedience.I'm not claiming we're obediant: as explained above (and as Aquinas explained it), it is wrong to be obediant to a bad order. We aren't rejecting the Church's authority: just like if I refuse to obey my father because he asks me to do something bad, that doesn't mean I reject his authority in principle: it's specific orders going against God's I'm indeed rejecting.10. There are conflicting sources on the subject, what are yours? But I don't really need this example anyway, Saint Paul is a better example.11. ""The disagreement was about personal conduct, not doctrine or governance.""It seems your theological opinion goes against Aquinas' : It must be observed, however, that **if the faith were endangered**, a subject ought to rebuke his prelate even publicly. Hence Paul, who was Peter's subject, rebuked him in public, **on account of the imminent danger of scandal concerning faith**, and, as the gloss of Augustine says on Gal. 2:11, ""Peter gave an example to superiors, that if at any time they should happen to stray from the straight path, they should not disdain to be reproved by their subjects.""12. ""Catholics of all of history, when a Pope uninfalibbly said something going against Tradition, stood up to them, just like they stood to all the Popes I mentioned."" Source? Well theologians stood up to John XXII. He retracted his material heresy to his deathbed. Are you on the side of the Catholics who said ""this is against tradition, I can't accept it, Holy Father you should stop teaching this""? The same goes for the other Popes I gave the example of.13. ""This and the other points \[...\] to Christ.""I am not rejecting infallible magisterium. Show me how my understanding of infalliblity, tradition and fidelity to God are false? Regarding communion, how do you define if someone's in communion or not?I'm not rejecting infallible magisterium. Just like the theologians refused John XXII's formal heresy, we refuse it from any pope. I'm basing what I believe on Tradition that has been proclaimed by popes in history, for example condemning religious freedom. Regarding the question of humility, this is how Aquinas answers it: ""Reply to Objection 3: To presume oneself to be simply better than one's prelate, would seem to savor of presumptuous pride; but there is no presumption in thinking oneself better in some respect, because, in this life, no man is without some fault. We must also remember that when a man reproves his prelate charitably, it does not follow that he thinks himself any better, but merely that he offers his help to one who, ""being in the higher position among you, is therefore in greater danger,"" as Augustine observes in his Rule quoted above. ""14. When you see all of those bishops preaching against the Catholic faith made cardinals, when you see the faithfull losing faith *en masse* in basic doctrinal points and embracing religious relativism, you have to realize that this is a crisis at least as bad as the Arian crisis. Hiding the doctrinal controversies plays the Enemy's game"

We receive the priests from the District House almost all weekends (excluding every second weekend of the month.)  \-We don't have a school like the other two big cities of the country, Guadalajara and Mexico, but this may change with the establishment of a Priory.

1fw0qc6,What specific parts of v2 do SSPX reject ,lqfbazv,None,1,"Thanks for being honest about the misleading part! So we agree we're debating between SSPX and sedevacantist, not among SSPX ;)Regarding material heresy, well still Aquinas is a material heretic. I'm of course aware that the dogma hadn't been defined yet, that was my point; the distinction between material heresy and formal heresy is very important one. In order to be a formal (aka proper) heretic, you need to formally deny a dogma. But that's not what the Pope nor VII are doing, of course they are saying things that contradict implications of the dogma, but they've never formally declined any dogma, that's the point.I agree that this could sound like a weird and unnecessary distinction to make; however this is a theological distinction that exists for a reason, we need to know when something's can be formally called a heresy or not.Now I do think that whatever Pope Francis is saying is materially heretic, but I don't think he believes he doesn't believe anymore in any dogma, or at least he hasn't said so publicly.That's actually what I like about the SSPX, they keep a very balanced position even if in the crisis of the Church it is very tempting not to be so, and they don't go farther that's what's needed.We should actually rejoice that the Pope, despite all he has done that keeps taking people away from the faith, is not a formal heretic; if he said ""I don't believe anymore in the transsubstantiation dogma"", sure things would be more ""clear"", but also it would be a great blow to Church.I keep hoping the liberal tendency within the Church can be replaced by a conservative one, which on the long run could become with God's help a traditionalist one, that's what's happening in my country (France) at least"
1fw0qc6,What specific parts of v2 do SSPX reject ,lqgu9r8,None,1,"Well if you want to get technical (even if there are other examples of saints not believing in dogmas before they were published, that's just one example, and even if this example isn't necessary to my point) biological knowledge of that time did believe that the soul would be created in the body after conception, he believed Mary had the stain of the original sin anyway, which is still contrary to the dogma. But if you have arguments against that I'd have no problem withdrawing my claim, Saint Thomas is one of the greatest saints ever and one hour ago I was at an abby where he has been for years, so any more proof he was right about everything is welcome!"
1fw0qc6,What specific parts of v2 do SSPX reject ,lqflq3l,None,1,"In order for a catholic to engage in heresy, he or she must have obstinate denial or doubt, which implies that it involves an act or thought which is made with sufficient knowledge and will to be ‚Äòobstinate‚Äô. This cannot be retroactively applied to St. Thomas nearly 600 years after his death. It seems to me you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what qualifies one to be a heretic, be it material or formal.I agree that the SSPX position is properly tempered to this crisis in the Church. Due to the confusion, stemming from the leadership in the Church, in which so many catholics are inundated, I have great sympathy for those who make the conclusion of sede vacante, even though I am not prepared to make such a conclusion.It seems quite odd to me that you would conclude that Bergoglio is not a formal heretic when he has repeatedly made heretical pronouncements, doubled and tripled down, refused filial correction from bishops and is now making up new sins and allying with other pertinacious heretics‚Äîeven to go so far as to co-author one of their books. I think you have to ignore heaps of evidence to think he is merely a material heretic who would self-correct if he was merely given the proper guidance in Church teaching.Whether or not this means he loses office, I think is a matter of subjective inference in Canon Law, but as an informed catholic, I can acknowledge errors from him, caution others to not engage in them and not follow them myself.""The scribes and the Pharisees have sitten on the chair of Moses. All things therefore whatsoever they shall say to you, observe and do: but according to their works do ye not; for they say, and do not.""  [Matthew 23:2-3]"
1fw0qc6,What specific parts of v2 do SSPX reject ,lqfrsq1,asimovsdog,2,"Apart from MarcellusFaber shilling sedevacantism again, it is only formal heresy if the person in question knows it to be against Catholic teaching. The definition of formal heresy is ""**conscious** knowledge that it is contradictory to the teachings of the Church"". If you put yourself into the mind of a modernist, the pope probably does think that what he is doing is helping the Church, although he is absolutely mistaken. He is a material heretic, no doubt, but for it to be formal, he'd have to be condemned by the Catholic Church, and since he is the head, that's going to be difficult.Even if the pope publicly professes heresy (as Francis did a couple days ago), no matter how public it is, he is not a formal heretic, only a material one.https://dominicansavrille.us/little-catechism-on-sedevacantism-part-i/https://dominicansavrille.us/little-catechism-on-sedevacantism-part-2/https://dominicansavrille.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Refutation-of-Sedevacantism.pdfhttps://catholiccandle.org/2024/09/26/cc-in-brief-sedevacantist-questions/The CMRI article is okay, but sedevacantism is not."

I think you have to ignore heaps of evidence to think he is merely a material heretic who would self-correct if he was merely given the proper guidance in Church teaching.""I'm obviously not defending Pope Francis, what he says is grave and materially heretic and leads many people to lose the faith as I said above. However, has he said anything about refusing a single dogma? Because that's what we would need to qualify him as a formal heretic. Even if a lot of the things he says are obviously be one day condemned as heretical by the Church, this is not the case. In order to be a formal heretic you have to formally refuse a dogma, Pope Francis has done a lot of bad things but he hasn't done that yet. Being obstinate is not necessarily even a doctrinal issue, and even in doctrine just because you keep disagreeing with a doctrinal point, as long as you don't deny an infallibly defined truth, you're not a formal heretic. My point was of course not to say ""Saint Thomas Aquinas = Pope Francis"", but rather to show that the definition of heresy can be tricky, and that accusing someone of formal heresy isn't something we can do from our personal judgment without prudence. Saint Thomas is one of the greatest saints ever, Pope Francis arguably one of the worst popes ever. The big difference with their material heresies is indeed that the dogma hadn't been proclaimed yet. Material heresy just means someone says something that objectively goes against the faith, wether the person saying it is culpable or not. So yes, technically, Saint Thomas Aquinas was a material heretic (since what he belive on one subject was against the faith), but of course that doesn't mean he should be held accountable because the dogma he argued against hadn't been proclaimed yet. Pope Francis on the other hand has the possibility to know that what he preaches goes against tradition, and also as a pope he has a much greater responsability. However, he doesn't have yet, thank God, negated publically any dogma.This might sound like a useless distinction, and also might sound like trying to diminsh the gravity Pope Francis' actions and words; it really isn't. The whole point of the SSPX in using that distinction is simply to try to have a balanced and precise judgment of the crisis. Also if the Church really didn't have a Pope, or if this pope was a formal heretic, this would be a great blow to the indefectibility of the Church, we don't want that.Take care!"

As mentioned before in this sub, in the crisis of the church - the official positions of the SSPX are true, moderate and balanced. The SSPX has the blessing of having such holy priests among its ranks who have truly upheld the Catholic faith. It has spread throughout the world and brought the traditional sacraments to people. Although ‚Äòcontroversial‚Äô we have the protection and guidance of our dear Abp Lefebvre who no one, not even his now atheist ex seminarians, or those who split with him deny that he is a saint, he has given us the groundwork for the mission of the SSPX today.

I see the SSPX as having the best doctrinal position in the current crisis in the Church. Refusing to compromise on any inch of Catholic doctrine, no matter the consequences. You can summarize it in 2 points:- since Vatican II Catholic doctrine (especially on the question of the dogma of Christ the king) is in danger in the hierarchy of the Church  - the NO Mass is ambiguous on the nature of Mass (doesn't portray it anymore as the sacrifice of Christ, leading to many people not realizing that anymore) and therefore we should say the traditional Mass.You should consider talking directly to an sspx priest, they'd love to tell you about it!

Certainly the FSSP which I attend only exists because of the SSPX.That said the FSSP, SSPX and other groups are basically sidelined and neutralized; right where the modernists want them. They aren't want for numbers but all the institutional power, and most of the souls reside within the regular parishes and diocese. This is why TC and other restrictions target the diocesan latin mass while the other groups are untouched.The hierarchy doesn't care if people are ""playing Traditional"" in isolated churches in parallel to the power structure based around the diocese.We need traditionalist churches in the regular parishes to clean up and celebrate Mass to the best of their abilities with the rubrics available, teach tradition, make confession, and the other sacraments available again. Eventually, these traditional diocesan Priests will become Bishops and Cardinals with real influence.

TLM organically developed, and it should last forever, but we always had multiple rites and if we invalidate one because of it only being good when equal to TLM, is kinda far, theres always a delicate balance we can keep beetween whats reasonably changable per organic development, and what we can never allow.For example we should never allow for massive rock concerts at mass with light shows.(obvious example)But I Grant you this its evil how people hijacked the church with liberal agenda and V2 certaingly allowed for that, we are obviously a divided church and I would stand with SSPX 100% than, a modern theologianNote: Yes NO is not perfect and needs changes to the rite regardless of any stance, but not to be used for replacing TLM ever"

We must always try to reunite with them but Abp Lefebvre tried before the consecrations and so did Bp Fellay in more recent times, and both were one sided games that they were playing with the society.

How could we do this if we cannot or are not permitted to identify them? St Alphonsus in his *Theologia Moralis* also writes of the obligation to denounce heretical family members to the Inquisition. We also see in history that the laity have identified heretics before a judgement of the Church and rejected them,the case of Nestorius, who was patriarch of Constantinople, being one example. The strongest argument is likely that the Church is a visible institution and is one in Faith, meaning that it must be visibly united in Faith. If the laity cannot identify who are Her members and who are not, then this unity has been destroyed and what the Church teaches about Herself as a matter of Faith untrue. To the objection that there are some fringe cases in which it is difficult to tell whether a particular person is a Catholic or not, requiring an investigation and a judgement by authority, one should refer to the error of the beard; simply because it can be difficult to tell exactly when stubble becomes a beard does not prove that cleanshaven-ness or beards do not exist.

My old parish priest refused to give my wife or I Communion on the tongue (we were standing) and arranged to meet us after Mass one week after he denied reception on the tongue for the third time. His ‚Äúpastoral ‚Äú catechises consisted of telling us it‚Äôs better to recieve on the hand because you are actually ‚Äúasking for Jesus‚Äù.  He then mumbled some stuff about priests not being special, the Church getting things wrong in the past (he was clearly going down the whole Protestant idea of the Priesthood of Believers) and finished with an ultimatum that we had to receive Communion there and then‚Ä¶but only on the hand.During this conversation, I told him neighbouring parishes allowed reception on the tongue - he said he didn‚Äôt care. And when I brought up the GIRM, he sneered and said ‚ÄúThat will all be changing soon‚Äù.Due to this we left and never returned.

Largely elderly congregation, young man playing the usual modern hymn list on a piano, lay readers, children sent to another room for 20 mins for the ‚ÄúChildren‚Äôs Liturgy‚Äù (ie. Drawing pictures of doves or rainbows), the ubiquitous extraordinary Eucharistic ministers slapping Christ into people‚Äôs hands, , the ‚Äúrisen Jesus‚Äù rather than a proper crucifix, etc.  I mean we aren‚Äôt talking about 20 min speed reading express masses, or priest walking around the altar playing the guitar and speaking in tongues, like some Masses I‚Äôve attended or been aware of over the decades.That said his attitudes are still certainly questionable. We saw the host being dropped several times (once involving my wife). A parishioner had to run up, pick Our Lord up, and consume it, while the priest looked on uninterested. That suggested to me either he despised Our Lord, or else had no belief in the Real Presence. This is what prompted my wife to try revert back to reception on the tongue (which had been suspended during Covid). Her third and final attempt led the priest to trying to force the host into her hands, leading to her jumping aside to avoid him.After we left that parish soon afterwards, we travelled to a parish where the priests were Jesuits. A beautiful old church (albeit the altar was not completely free of VII vandalism). However the sermon was focused around the Synod on Synodality, which made us uneasy. As we left we met a woman who had travelled from another far away parish. When I asked what brought her there, she looked sad and sheepishly explained that she remembered it from when she was studying in teacher college. She felt she couldn‚Äôt attend her own parish anymore. She said they had completely removed the tabernacle and it felt more like a Protestant prayer group. We shared our own experience as the reason as to why we were there. As we walked out, I told my wife that I knew of somewhere a few streets away that offered the TLM. She said she was willing to have a look. Unfortunately we had missed Mass but lifted a few leaflets and left. I explained about the SSPX to my wife at home later and she agreed to go back and try it the next Sunday. What an experience. A High Mass. The smell of incense pervading, the silence, the rood screen, the Asperges, the Gregorian chant from the Schola, the homily, the demeanour of the people, the bows and genuflections and constant signs of reverence, the people kneeling at the altar rail waiting to recieve Our Lord. When Mass was ended we were positively beaming. I think my first word was ‚ÄúWow!‚ÄùIt felt like I had spent an hour in Heaven, been granted a foretaste. If that was Heaven, I‚Äôd take it in a heartbeat. My wife was in full agreement. She said she actually felt angry later that our generation had been robbed of that experience. We spoke to the priests and told him our story, and how we had met a woman in a similar sad situation. He said it was sad but increasingly common that Roman Catholics were becoming Roaming Catholics, trying to find a parish which still preserved some modicum of Catholicism.As we left and walked downstairs of the chapel, my young son said ‚ÄúDad, I love the Latin Mass.

The SSPX justify everything they do under crisis mode, but it‚Äôs not a crisis if we have a diocesan TLM near us. Hope through prayer and research we reach the same point.

I used to think it was intrinsically Protestant and thus offensive to God, but even if the motives were Protestant, nothing about the NO is in it of itself Protestant. It‚Äôs just a mutilated Catholic liturgy, but still Catholic. Finding out that Ottavani later said he didn‚Äôt have a problem with the Novus Ordo and taking back his ‚Äúintervention‚Äù also gave me a different perspective. I read The Problem of the liturgical reform too, and it expresses valid concerns, definitely some deficiencies compared to the Tridentine mass, but even after reading it I found that the NO is not intrinsically Protestant since it technically doesn‚Äôt express Protestant belief, to my view at least.

1ewt03c,Opinion on Post Conciliar Saints?,lj1kw3y,None,6,"After the Council a reform was made on the process of canonization. To sum it up the change made it faster but less serious. For example, they reduced the number of necessary miracles for a canonization. More importantly, they changed the definition of what's considered being a saint (it used to be someone who practices virtue to a heroic level).The previous process was considered by most theologians as infallible, the SSPX's position is that there is doubt on the infallibility of the new one. The reason the SSPX ""only"" had doubts, and doesn't straight up condemn it, is that it doesn't have the authority to do so (only a Pope could), but the mew canonization is definitely considered problematicSo it doesn't mean all those people aren't saints, it just means we aren't infallibly sure thay they are. For example Archbishop Lefebvre was a big fan of Padre Pio, he even said Mass so that he would be canonized, but we still don't call him saint Padre Pio (even if most people, like myself, personally believe he's a saint)"
1ewt03c,Opinion on Post Conciliar Saints?,lj1syno,dbaughmen,4,"Canonisations post v2 are definitely not infallible, some of the people being canonised are purely political moves. Carlo Acutis was a way to appeal to the ‚Äúyouth‚Äù who play ‚Äúvideo games‚Äù. JPII is most definitely not a saint, he was canonised due to his extreme charisma and popularity with the Novus Ordites. Mother Teresa had been rumoured to be a horrible person. Until the church goes back to normal we can‚Äôt define who‚Äôs a saint and who‚Äôs not."
1ewt03c,Opinion on Post Conciliar Saints?,lj22qr9,Piancol,4,"As with mostly everything post-conciliar, the safest bet is just to ignore it. We don't really need all these new saints, having such a long and rich history of infallible canonizations."

That's not the question though, as I said in a comment. What matters isn't if we personally believe those canonized people are saints or not (our opinion ultimately doesn't matter), but if they are infallibly canonized or not. It would be stupid from us to pretend that any person canonized by Pope Francis has to be a horrible person."

1ew6sve,Does anyone know where to find a list of all the offices and vestments and everything Paul VI abolished? ,lix3bcv,Piklikl,4,"It's hard to find a comprehensive list online for something like this, so I asked ChatGPT:Pope Paul VI, during his papacy (1963‚Äì1978), implemented significant reforms within the Catholic Church, particularly in the wake of the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965). These reforms led to the abolition or modification of various offices, vestments, and practices. Below is a list summarizing some of the key changes made by Paul VI:# Liturgical and Ceremonial Changes:1. **Triregnum (Papal Tiara):**   * **Abolished Use:** Pope Paul VI was the last pope to wear the papal tiara during his coronation in 1963. He subsequently abandoned its use and symbolically laid it on the altar of St. Peter's Basilica. The tiara has not been worn by any pope since.2. **Galero (Cardinal's Hat):**   * **Abolished Use:** The red galero, traditionally given to cardinals during consistory, was discontinued. Cardinals now receive a red biretta instead.3. **Pontifical Court:**   * **Reorganization and Abolition:** The elaborate papal court, including titles like ""Prince Assistant to the Papal Throne,"" was significantly simplified. Many ceremonial positions and titles were either abolished or transformed into honorifics without ceremonial functions.4. **Liturgical Vestments:**   * **Abolished or Simplified:** Several traditional vestments such as the **papal slippers, stockings, and buskins** were discontinued. The use of ornate vestments, such as the **fanon** (a striped papal shoulder cape), was also significantly reduced.5. **Sedia Gestatoria:**   * **Abolished Use:** This ceremonial throne, used to carry the pope in processions, fell out of regular use under Paul VI. It was later replaced by the popemobile.6. **Simplification of the Papal Mass:**   * **Reforms:** The elaborate papal Mass was simplified. Many traditional elements, such as the use of the subdeacon, tunicle, and certain intricate liturgical vestments, were abolished.# Abolished Ecclesiastical Offices:1. **Abolition of Minor Orders:**   * **Subdeacon and Other Minor Orders:** The minor orders, including the subdiaconate, were abolished in 1972 through the motu proprio *Ministeria Quaedam*. These were replaced with the instituted ministries of lector and acolyte.2. **Master of the Sacred Palace:**   * **Reformed Role:** This office, traditionally held by a Dominican friar and functioning as the pope's theological adviser, was transformed into the Theologian of the Pontifical Household, with a more academic and less ceremonial function.3. **Abolition of Certain Honorific Titles:**   * **Examples:** Titles such as ""Patriarch of the West"" were abandoned, reflecting the ecumenical and simplified approach of Paul VI's papacy.# Liturgical Reforms (Post-Vatican II):# Missal of 1969 (Paul VI Missal):Abolition of the Tridentine Mass (1962 Missal): Although not completely abolished, the widespread use of the Tridentine Mass was replaced by the new Mass of Paul VI, which introduced significant changes, including the use of the vernacular, a simplified liturgy, and a revised calendar.Suppression of Certain Feasts and Prayers:Liturgical Calendar Reform: The liturgical calendar was revised, leading to the abolition or downgrading of certain feast days and the simplification of the sanctoral cycle. Some traditional prayers, like the Last Gospel at the end of Mass, were also removed.Sacrament of Tonsure:Abolished: The tonsure, a clerical rite of initiation that marked the entrance into the clerical state, was abolished in favor of a simpler process of admission to candidacy for ordination.Other Reforms:Papal Coronation:Abolished: Pope Paul VI was the last pope to have a coronation ceremony with the papal tiara. He later decided that future popes would not have a coronation but would be inaugurated with a simpler ceremony.Reduction of Ceremonial Protocols:General Simplification: Paul VI initiated the reduction of numerous ceremonial and courtly protocols associated with the papacy, opting for a simpler, more pastoral approach.Abolished Practices:Kissing of the Pope's Foot:Discontinued: This medieval practice, symbolizing the pope's supreme authority, was quietly discontinued during Paul VI's papacy.Conclusion:Paul VI‚Äôs papacy was marked by a decisive move towards modernization, reflecting the spirit of the Second Vatican Council. His reforms aimed to make the Church's liturgy, governance, and practices more accessible and understandable to the modern world, often by simplifying or abolishing older, more complex traditions."

You had no ill intentions about it and the biggest proof is that you're worried you messed up.Ask around to figure out who he is, and if he turns out to be a priest and you see him again then go greet him appropriately and mention how last time you would've done the same if you knew.

Lefebvre hypothetically could have other reasons for omitting the name, such as protesting certain actions or policies of the pope without rejecting his papal legitimacy.

This man has stated that Luther was ‚Äúwas not wrong about justification‚Äù on his flight returning from Armenia in 2016), that the death penalty is ‚Äòinadmissible‚Äô, and has made it clear that he is a latitudinarian (religious indifferentist). You may try to escape this by saying that he did not teach any of these positions authoritatively, but this is very clearly untenable in the case of the death penalty for:1. He changed the catechism to reflect this change in doctrine, and not only changed it, but admitted that the Church had formerly taught the opposite, as if She can err in her teaching: https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20180801_lettera-vescovi-penadimorte_en.html2. He taught in Amoris Laetitia, paragraph 83, that ‚Äòthe Church firmly rejects the death penalty‚Äô. He also does this in the context of rejecting abortion and euthanasia in the same paragraph, putting it in the same category as murder of the innocent, which is quite clearly intrinsically wrong. Some people have tried to escape this by claiming that this is simply a change in discipline, a prudential matter. However. The problem with this is that the Church has no discipline concerning the death penalty, for she has never used it (Ecclesia non sitit sanguinem; all executions of heretics were carried out by the State); the State has the right, and even the obligation in certain circumstances, to impose the death penalty *through the natural law*, and the Church cannot take that away. See the following: https://www.vatican.va/content/dam/francesco/pdf/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20160319_amoris-laetitia_en.pdfYour next thought after this may be simply that the legitimacy of the death penalty is not de fide. This is an untenable position for the following reasons:1. St Robert Bellarmine stated in chapter II of De Laicis that one of the heresies of the Anabaptists is their rejection of the death penalty. See an English translation here: https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.260111/page/n11/mode/1up?view=theater2. Cardinal Juan de Lugo states also in his Disputationes Morales et Scholasticae (Disp. X, Sectio II, pg. 57), that the heretical Waldensians held the same position. He then goes on to affirm its legitimacy, stating that all Catholic theologians do so also. See the following: https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0rQOAAAAQAAJ&pg=GBS.PA56&hl=en_US (No English translation this time, I‚Äôm afraid, but you could run it through ChatGPT).3. Innocent III included the legitimacy of the death penalty in his profession of Faith against the Waldensians. See Denzinger 425 (1948 edition).4. Leo X condemned Luther‚Äôs proposition that ‚Äúit is against the will of the Spirit‚Äô that heretics be burned. See Denzinger 773.4. The significance of the fact that all Catholic theologians agree is that a moral consensus of the theologians, due to the intimate connexion of their teaching and the Church‚Äôs, is infallible. This is because, if they erred as a whole, then the Church would necessarily be led into error, which is impossible.5. The ordinary magisterium of the Church is just as infallible as the extraordinary magisterium, and the ordinary magisterium has taught consistently (in catechisms, sermons, etc.) for centuries that the death penalty is legitimate. If we say that the death penalty is ‚Äòinadmissible‚Äô, then we also have to say that the Church has changed Her teaching, Her teaching which has been taught by the ordinary magisterium. You may retort that the bishops together with the Pope now teach the immorality of the death penalty, which you would believe to be infallible. But this doesn‚Äôt solve our problem, as we now have an infallible Church contradicting Herself. The solution is that infallibility flows from the Pope, and when there is no Pope, the bishops‚Äô teaching is not infallible, for the ordinary magisterium is the teaching of the bishops *together with the Pope*. It is simply more proof that the Holy See is currently vacant.So you are stuck; you must submit to the man whom you believe to be Pope, but you are also bound to publicly profess the legitimacy of the death penalty, otherwise you become a heretic and fall out of the Church. Of course, you can simply cling to tradition as taught by St Paul in Galatians 1:8 (and rightly so) and suspend judgement as to the current state of the Papacy, but the fact remains that you do not submit to Francis (presuming you remain a Catholic), and simply recognising him as Pope does not change that, for recognition is not submission to laws and teaching."

The family protects human life in all its stages, including its last. Consequently, ‚Äúthose who work in healthcare facilities are reminded of the moral duty of conscientious objection.

1ep8u3n,Why SSPX over other canonical societies even though the SSPX are suspended? ,lhpa7gb,Cathain78,3,"I think it‚Äôs important to understand the situation within the Church during the early 20th century when Pope St Pius X saw clear dangers within the Church and attempted to brace it against them, then in the middle of that century during the time of the Second Vatican Council, and after that the formation of the SSPX in order to preserve what was in danger of being lost. If you haven‚Äôt already then read the Archbishop‚Äôs ‚ÄúOpen Letter to Confused Catholics‚Äù which explains some of this and also gives more detail on the changes which swept through the Church even before the Council had concluded. Add to that some research on what people like Bugnini were openly admitting they were trying to do, and how much of what we see in the Church today is a continuation of those aims.Finally, look at the legalities of the society‚Äôs position with all of this in mind. I‚Äôm not saying Canon Law is not important - albeit even Canon Law itself was changed and ‚Äúupdated‚Äù in the early 80‚Äôs. Ironically, sometimes these changes even lent themselves to the SSPXs situation (eg. The section on fulfilling one‚Äôs Sunday obligation). But I think the legal status is perhaps the least important of all these considerations although they can‚Äôt be simply dismissed, of course. Why do I say that?Well a couple of things spring to mind. And this is only my personal opinion. We hear Saint Paul write to the Corinthians regarding the Law - the letter of which kills but the spirit of which gives life. Perhaps this is what is in the mind of Pope Francis when he frequently rails against legalism, clericalism and ‚Äúrigidity‚Äù?  Odd then that the opponents of the SSPX, so often liberal in other ways, suddenly switch to being very rigid in their legalism when the status of the society comes up in discussion. We should remember that the highest law in the Church is, and always has been, the salvation of souls. And if the society is saving souls in a time when souls are deserting the faith in record numbers, then who could reasonably argue that it isn‚Äôt carrying out the highest law of the Church while its detractors point fingers and refer to the letter of the law? Finally, the SSPX refer to the law itself stating that they are acting even in accordance, not only in spirit but by the very letter in that they are permitted to legally carry out their ministry and the sacraments without the Ordinary‚Äôs sanction in a time of great need and crisis (re Supplied Jurisdiction). And here it hinges on one‚Äôs opinion - is the Church in crisis at this time? Well, that depends on who you ask.  The SSPX clearly believe that since the changes to the liturgy and the theology at VII, the changes in the faith of laity and clergy alike following this, the closing of churches, the dwindling of clerical and religious vocations since the Council, etc then yes, there is a crisis in the Church that validates the mandates within Canon Law to allow them to carry out their priestly ministries. The same reason that St Athanasius was justified in persevering in administering to the faithful even when the heretical bishops opposed him, even as he was exiled for the umpteenth time by the ecclesiastical authorities of his age. As the Saint remarked- ‚ÄúThey have the buildings, we have the faith‚Äù I hope you research, and pray for guidance, and find the truth in these times of confusion. Be assured of one thing and that is  Christ‚Äôs promise - the gates of Hell will not prevail against His Church.To end with another quote by that great saint and Church Father ‚Ä¶.‚ÄúEven if Catholics faithful to tradition are reduced to a handful, they are the ones who are the true Church of Jesus Christ.‚Äù -St Athanasius"

(Slight exception here for the IBP)  - The other Canonical Societies are entirely beholden to the Modernist Bureaucrats in Rome, and as they have no Bishop of their own, they depend on them for Ordaining their Priests and approving their development. The SSPX does not have this problem and this is why they are consistently expanding and why the Canonical Societies are consistently being rejected from Diocese after Diocese.  - The other Canonical Societies seem to reject the fact that there even is a Crisis in the Church (Exception here for the IBP)"

Supra lex, salus animarum: above the law, the salvation of souls.

1ekjru6,What do you think about the SSPX Resistance and Bishop Williamson?,lgl7tqy,None,10,"The ""resistance"" (they often don't like this word) started in the 2010s when the rumor started that SSPX was preparing an agreement with Rome, an agreement in which the SSPX would do doctrinal compromissions. While it is true that dome of the heads of the SSPX had talks about it and considered it, it ended up not doing it and never signing any compromising documents.I once talked about it with an SSPX priests who had a very balanced opinion on the matter I think; he basically told me that the mistake of the resistance wasn't to refuse any doctrinal compromission (they're right to say so), but that they lacked prudence: they started openly and publicly attacking the SSPX, often violently, instead of waiting for the SSPX to actually make a compromise before leaving it.Regarding bishop Williamson, the resistance is only part of the issue, he's mostly a problem because he took public positions on subjects that shouldn't be concern a bishop, like the Holocaust.Also, from personal experience, people in the resistance usually have ties with sedevacantism, but most of them disagree with that"

1eiy9jt,Justify Disobedience,lga7tg0,Piklikl,17,"The Church has made it clear throughout the centuries of the importance of the Liturgy and the Tridentine Rite. What the Church teaches 500 years ago, is still true today.Post Vatican II, the Church has stopped defining any dogma (the last time being establishing the doctrine of the Assumption of Our Lady in 1950). This makes sense as there‚Äôs overwhelming evidence that Vatican II (not a dogmatic council) has problems with some of the documents (the Church cannot teach error).Essentially, the only justification for the radical changes is an appeal to authority, ie ‚Äúbecause I said so‚Äù (actually it‚Äôs more like ‚Äúbecause the Pope said I could speak for him, and this is what I know he would want‚Äù, looking at you Bugnini), instead of a well reasoned expansion on existing teachings. While the men who happen to be alive today and are in positions of authority in the Church would never outright ban the Tridentine Rite (look at the backlash that happens every time they attempt to suppress it), they know that if they can cut off the ‚Äúsupply‚Äù of the Mass, ie well formed priests using the methods handed down through the centuries, it would only be a matter of time before there was no one left to celebrate it. They intended to do this by controlling all the bishops and not allowing them to ordain men set on celebrating the TLM.The SSPX did everything it could to ‚Äúplay ball‚Äù with Rome. Rome even approved the candidates and all that remained was for Rome to approve a date of the episcopal consecrations. Archbishop Lefebvre soon realized that Rome was just giving him the run around and waiting for him to die. If he did not consecrate the 4 Bishops, the SSPX would have been unable to continue with its mission which is the formation of priests in the traditional methods.The Tridentine Mass would not be at the level it is today if the 4 Bishops were not ordained (it‚Äôs an open secret that Rome only tolerates the Ecclesiastical Dei organizations as a way of drawing faithful away from the SSPX in an attempt to eliminate it). If you love the Latin Mass in 2024, you owe a debt of gratitude to Archbishop Lefebvre because he closely followed the dictates of his conscience, recognized the crisis in the Church, and chose to disobey men instead of offending God."

The Novus Ordo is dangerous for the faith (since it's made to be half protestant), therefore it's bad for priests not to be able to say the TLM.""Supra lex, salus animarum"" : ""above the law is the salvation of souls""; it's more important to do good than to obey.The whole point of infallibility is for Catholics to know when exactly they HAVE to obey no matter what, even if they don't understand; everything else is subject to personal interpretation unless there is theological evidence against it. The NO and Vatican II's ideas are definitely not infallible, therefore if they are evil (which is the case) it's necessary for us not to submit to them.In my opinion, it's not only that we can disobey, it's that we have to!I have a brother who was ordained in the SSPX last month, happiest day of my life!Anyway, I'll pray for you!"

You'll see soon enough that they can't speak freely about theological problems (I have a cousin in ICKSP), that they're theologicaly divided and incoherent (Wach, superior of ICKSP, think the Bshp Lefebvre was a saint, but my cousin think he was a schismatic and truly excommunicated) and that Rome could force them to celebrate NOM wherever they want (one of my parents friends, priest in ICKSP, told us that being in SSPX would be preferable for security reasons), but I really think you shouldn't do things that you don't find rightful."

Who knows if the next Pontiff is as bad as the current one or even worse. I had priest friends confide with me that they are 'not pleased' where it's going. I could not help but feel they are 'handcuffed' and are puppets by the secular Vatican. Truly heartbreaking.I don't think God cares if SSPX is separated from the Vatican. The Vatican is not God to really separate it from the Church's body. If the formula of the mass (that has worked for centuries and has proven to produce good fruit) appeals to you, it shows your love for reverence and respect to spending time with God compared to the Protestant-like NO format. In my book, SSPX is upholding a tradition that the faithful should NOT be deprived from.I'm quite sure God appreciates the highest form of prayer more when it demands pure reverence, solemnity and respect compared to a worship that appeals to a secular world. The church nowadays prioritizes what's appealing and conforming to the secular world over what's proper to God. I, myself, would rather disobey a man, than disobey God.

I hesitated for a while because as a kid I'd go to NO on some occasions, so at some point as an adult I had to chose if I had to follow the SSPX on this question or not.Have you read the short critical exam of the NO? Because the consequence of it is to believe that there is something doctrinally wrong with the NO, not only because of the dangerous freedoms it leaves to the priests, not only because of the language translations (since this study was made right after the NO was published, so when it was still in latin), but because of its very essence.Indeed, the NO in general doesn't reflect the Catholic sense of Mass (sacrifice of Christ), but the Protestant one (a meal in memory of the last supper). Which had the consequence of making millions of Catholics around the world, including priests, losing the faith in the Catholic sense of the Mass.So the NO is still valid (it's still the body of Christ in the Host), but the rite isn't properly Catholic, and it makes people lose the faith.I wouldn't say it's necessarily sinful though, I'd argue it's not most of the time, because for something to be sinful people need to be fully conscious of what's wrong with it; and the difference between the NO and the TLM is very subtle for most people, even if it's very deep. So it'd only be a sin for someone who perfectly knows how the NO is in essence dangerous for the faith and protestant.Something that stroke me was how similar the NO was to the Protestant reformation; deleting the offertory, translating everything,... At the beginning most protestants believed in the real presence (strict Lutherans still do), but progressively they lost the faith in more and more aspects of the Mass"

The thing is that the SSPX is only going to be more disobedient to the Pope unless they actually become a canonical society. Their bishops are old so they will need to (illicitly) consecrate bishops again which would constitute as a second schismatic act. They already operate as a completely separate church and with two schismatic acts without remorse, they eventually could be considered as schismatics. The SSPX is a very extreme path to go on since the justification for being able to celebrate Mass as SSPX (suspended priests) is mostly based on the idea that the novus Ordo is sinful and unpleasant to God which causes a crisis and that crisis allows people to go to SSPX.

1eiy9jt,Justify Disobedience,lnkzqdu,Smooth_Ad_5775,1,"‚ÄúI have rejoiced profoundly to read the Discourse by the Holy Father on the question of the new Ordo Missae, and especially the doctrinal precisions contained in his discourses at the public Audiences of November 19 and 26[a] after which I believe, no one can any longer be genuinely scandalized. As for the rest, a prudent and intelligent catechesis must be undertaken to solve some legitimate perplexities which the text is capable of arousing.

IYou also gotta explain how it‚Äôs no longer pleasing to God. Did God tell you? Why would the same sacrifice on Calvary be displeasing to God even if offered up reverently?

You only need to read the protestant reactions after the new mass was promulgated to understand how different the mass is at its very core. If protestants can now worship without objection at the catholic mass, that speaks volumes imo. It goes along with the new theology that came out of V2.Is God pleased with this? I don‚Äôt know. I have a hard time believing he would be ok with the watering down of the mass and theology to appease protestants. I used to have hang ups about the SSPX position on the NO and I still don‚Äôt agree with it being sinful to attend but looking at the big picture, I understand why they take the position(s) they do.

Catholic creators I‚Äôve been following for a while are standing against the SSPX, and they seem pretty genuine. While there are some genuine sspxers, some can be quite vulgar and intense and it seems like they never are charitable with the Pope. Idk if I‚Äôve seen a trad say they love Pope Francis. I think we can love the Pope, even if we dislike what he does. I get why there is a lot of hate behind this, since the church has lost so much since Vatican 2. Everyone just acts like it‚Äôs all clear cut when it‚Äôs not. People are definitely being uncharitable from both sides, can you agree with me on that at least? I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll talk to a priest because he‚Äôll probably just tell me to read a book or something which I‚Äôm already doing.

I can‚Äôt imagine he would be pleased by most of what came out of V2. Maybe the better word would be tolerated. "
1eifxp5,Sedevacantist mass attendance ,lg6t2mu,MarcellusFaber,6,"Strange that you should ask this; I‚Äôve just commented on it in another thread. In short, the reasons for not going would be 1) You do not believe that the priest is a Catholic 2) The priest is a vitandus or declared tolerated excommunicate (impossible in my opinion, but also extremely unlikely and easily verifiable if it is possible) 3) There would be a danger to your Faith or scandal to others.As to one, the only possibilities are that he is a heretic or a schismatic. As to heresy, I would ask the grounds for the accusation (I believe it to be nonsense). As to schism, those who refuse submission to the Roman Pontiff due to reasonably doubting the validity of his election are not schismatic. See Wernz-Vidal 7:398 (I can provide other references if necessary). To say that our contention that Francis is not Pope due to his blatant heresy is unreasonable is ridiculous; perhaps you may disagree, but the major premise of our syllogism is the common teaching of the theologians and canonists, even if there is a small number that disagree.As to 2), as an SSPX attendee, I doubt you are terribly bothered by the prospect of excommunication by the supposed authorities. That said, I find it extremely unlikely that a ‚ÄòSede‚Äô priest has been excommunicated by name, which is what is necessary for us to be forbidden to attend his Mass or request the Sacraments from him.As to 3), how would he be a danger to your Faith? First, I doubt that he would preach at a week-day Mass, and second, their preaching is in general good and not dissimilar from the preaching of SSPX priests. Perhaps you would be afraid that he would bring up the question of the vacancy, which perhaps you think might tempt you to believe that the gates of hell have prevailed (a nonsensical idea)? Would a Catholic have been justified in avoiding the Mass of a Molinist Catholic priest in the past simply because he believed that Molinism is blasphemous and leads to atheism (despite it never having been censured), worrying that he may mention it in a sermon and endanger his Faith? He would have very weak Faith if that were the case. In the case of scandal, it must be remembered that there must actually be a person to be scandalised. Who could that be? Also, the answer would be to simply not tell them. The giving up of spiritual benefits due to pharisaical scandal is also only obliged in limited circumstances.I have one last thing: not receiving Holy Communion at the Mass makes no difference; if you cannot receive Holy Communion due to who is saying the Mass, you also cannot participate (cannot have communicatio in sacris), and it would be a sin to go at all except in the circumstance that you are going to simply be passively present for the sake of civil honour (which you are not). If you are going to participate in the Mass for spiritual benefit, then it makes no sense at all not to receive Holy Communion if you are in a state of grace.The justification in law for this is canons 2261 and 2284 of the 1917 code, which allow the laity to approach suspended priests or even undeclared tolerated excommunicates, for the Sacraments for any just reason (wishing to attend daily Mass certainly qualifies according to the commentaries on the canon). The equivalent canon in the ‚Äò83 code is canon 1335, if you believe that one to be in force (which it is not)."
1eifxp5,Sedevacantist mass attendance ,lggjv02,Minute_Television262,3,"Sedes and SSPX are basically doing the same thing. One just thinks Francis is a pope and the other thinks Francis is an antipope.

Ultramontanism always had two sides to it as a political philosophy: Joseph de Maistre's view in his book ""On the Pope"" vs Lamennais who was a liberal, believed in separation of church and state, democracy etc.When someone used to define Toryism, he would refer to it as a political philosophy centred around God, King and Country. Socially conservative, fundamentally Christian in spirit, and economically leaning towards protectionism and paternalism. Today the insulting parody version is secularist, very socially liberal and treats the country like an economic zone rather than as an ancient nation with its own customs, language and culture. They support gay marriage, gender ideology, late-term abortion, multiculturalism, euthanasia, criminalizing prayer etc.I can cite Mary Whitehouse's books against libertine permissive society, Samuel Johnson's books, Richard Hooker's The laws of ecclesiastical polity, Quintin Hogg's book on conservatism, Keith G. Feiling's books on the history of the Tory Party and Samuel Coleridge Taylor's works to give the sense of actual Tory beliefs. The other interlocutor will not care however and continue to insist on the parody version because it's the one with power and authority. Your citation of an outdated article from the time of Pope St. Pius X and two 19th Century theologians has the same power as me trying to argue in favour of High Toryism.When you look at Rome, reality collides with fancy imagination. The ultramontanist is not a man who believes in state religion, the Kingship of Christ, defending God's morality and uncompromising hostility to the ideas of the encyclopedists and the philosophes. The ultramontanist at the Court of Rome is still a follower of absolute monarchy, true enough, but he takes it to such a level where The Lord Pope turns into a Vice-God on earth and the Church is a slave to the Vice-God Supreme Roman Pontiff.The ultramontanist is otherwise very socially liberal, more likely than not a Jesuit or sympathetic to them, supports radical development of doctrine theology, rules the Roman Court like any other secular Court by having a bank which is embroiled in countless financial scandals, has an affinity for Masonic ideology by emphasizing false ecumenism and equality of all religions and believes with sincere heart that The Lord Pope has the right to alter the deposit of faith through the authority of Christ.Ultramontanists such as Cardinal Ghirlanda SJ believe that The Lord Pope has unlimited power and may even alter the text of sacred scripture itself, and that he is infallible in everything he says and does. Other Jesuits like Cardinals Hollerich SJ and Martini SJ are also stern ultramontanists and incredibly socially liberal. Francis in fact has Cardinal Martini SJ as his role model.As much as I like Cardinal Billot and Pope Pius IX, I simply do not live in the 19th Century. The Roman Curia is the source of endless abuse, scandals and heresy. It caused greater damage than Napoleon ever did. Being a mindless flatterer of the Court of Rome has severe negative impacts on one's spirituality and may lead to losing one's faith entirely, plenty of such cases exist. To be a traditionalist in this era wicked era means categorical opposition to the infernal Court of Rome which has the gall to corrupt the faith of Christ.[https://www.lifesitenews.com/blogs/cdl-muller-theory-of-popes-unlimited-power-contradicts-the-entire-catholic-tradition/](https://www.lifesitenews.com/blogs/cdl-muller-theory-of-popes-unlimited-power-contradicts-the-entire-catholic-tradition/)"

The refutation of that ecclesiological model (e.g. one where the King/State can do literally nothing whatsoever to alter the situation) is contained in the hundreds or maybe even thousands of ultra-richerist groups who have no unity amongst each other. Every autonomous unit holds whatever the local Priest or Bishop claims, whose doubtful orders may sometimes come from an Old Catholic line. One group will teach that Jews go to heaven, the other group will permit meat on Fridays, yet another one will have altar girls. This is the Achilles heel of sedevacantism, we are facing a Protestantization of the Catholic faith with no central authority which can regulate seminaries, discipline, ordinations, catechisms etc. I am a not a sede out of principle, that is someone who believes that we have to endlessly pray for reprieve from the Cromwellian tyrants and that the spiritual sphere has total supremacy over the secular sphere (as shown in Joseph de Maistre's book), thereby excluding all defensive action by a Catholic State and/or Catholic prince. My sedevacantism is by coincidence, I am forced to endure this regretful situation, at heart I am a regalist whose thought is rooted in the honourable faculty of the Sorbonne and history. If we had a Catholic prince, I'd be the first to demand the immediate appointment of another pope when the momentum is great enough. But until something like that becomes viable the Catholic state has to defend itself by banning all communication, withdrawing funding, enacting radical regium placet, cleansing the local national church from abuse, heresy, fill the dioceses with Catholic Bishops etc.  Ultra-richerism is fundamentally insulting to one's intelligence and historically illiterate.The Catholic prince can and must defend his national church. >illegitimate Curia causes scandalThe Curia and the Jesuits have caused the greatest crisis of ecclesiology and faith in history. They have forfeited their right to continued existence and need to fade into history. The infernal Roman Court did not exist before 1088, the apostate Jesuit Order did not exist before 1540.

Did they blindly stick to one claimant? No, they deposed them all and the Catholic states acted as if no pope existed.The other guy already cited the 1398 Council in Paris by King Charles VI - that is a realistic way to proceed.

1eifxp5,Sedevacantist mass attendance ,lg9y1as,TooEdgy35201,2,"The old and most honoured theological faculty of the Sorbonne has left a very valuable study to posterity. In 1398 King Charles VI of France called a national council in order to determine what to do in case of schism and doubtful papal claimants. The royal decree of the council is reproduced in the work of Pithou, and the acts of the council may be found in Coleti Collection,  15th volume p. 1003. By 247 to 300 votes it was decided that in the absence of a genuine papal claimant, that EVERYTHING that may have had to do with the Roman Pontiff (dispensations etc.) would automatically descend on the local Bishop (e.g. episcopalism). Furthermore, they discontinued funding, forbade all appeals, as well as communication in temporal as well as spiritual matters with the Papal pretenders. Suffragan Bishops would be invested by the Metropolitan Bishop, and the Metropolitan one would in turn also appoint his successor beforehand without any need of confirmation by the Pope given that he was absent.The church continued to exist without the silliness of the ultra-richerist sede groups. One group, the apologists for the Court of Rome, claim that the Church defects when there is a heretical papal claimant, but it can continue to exist perfectly well in fact, another (ultra-richerists) - claim that you must just continue to run your autonomous unit ad infinitum without any chance of restoration except by a miracle.

What happens today when you suggest that the papal office is bound by the ancient canons? It is in direct opposition to the ultramontane creed as seen in the condemnation of the 3rd article of the 1682 Declaration, whose authors were applying 1st Millennium standards to the papal office.

The equivalent canon in the ‚Äò83 code is canon 1335.2) Those who refuse submission to the Roman Pontiff because they reasonably doubt the validity of his election are not schismatic. There are various authorities for this, the most commonly cited being Wernz-Vidal 7:398, who gives the particular example of those who initially refused submission to Urban VI, recently cited by Vigan√≤. The key element in schism is pertinacious refusal to submit, not refusal to recognise on its own (though I concede that in most cases, it would be unlikely to find the one without the other).The only justification, other than stating that one would rather not take advantage of the Church‚Äôs generosity in this regard, for refusing to attend ‚ÄòSede‚Äô Masses (as if Catholic Masses should be placed in different categories according to the theological opinions of the Catholic priest saying them; it is like speaking of a ‚ÄòMolinist‚Äô Mass), is that they are not Catholic. Perhaps true in particular cases, but not true in the vast majority. On what grounds? They are not heretics, and I have already answered the question of schism.I add the caveat that one should be cautious of the Independent chapels on the directory.

It is no good to say that a man is Pope but refuse to obey him.

St. Augustine argued that human nature was driven by original sin, making politics a morally compromised activity driven by self-interest and lust for power. He viewed politics as a necessary evil, in order to maintain order in a fallen world, where true justice was unattainable. For St Augustine, the purpose of politics was limited to securing peace, a relative good shared by both the sinful city of man and the virtuous city of god. Both are essential for the political phylosophy and the idea of state, equality, fairness, etc. As well as Religion. St. Augustine was important figure during Baroque era after 30y. war (1618-1648), which was this brutal, messy fight in Europe, religion and politics- Catholics vs. Protestants."

1egtnha,Who are the MC-SSPX,lfzn3w4,MitthrawnuruodoVCR,2,the resistance was born in 2012 when Williamson left. Now there are at least 3 different organizations calling them some version of it and they all bad-mouth each other as well.
1egtnha,Who are the MC-SSPX,lfvymmv,craft00n,8,"I'm not an SSPX member, SSPX is a community of priests, and I don't think there's any SSPX priests here. Nonetheless, every SSPX priest that I spoke to is obviously willing to have a normal canonical situation once the crisis that started all this is resolved. Lefebvre didn't ordain without a reason, he thought the current modernist crisis in Rome was dangerous for the faithful's salvation, and every SSPX priest agrees with it in theory. If you don't think that Lefebvre was right when he ordained priests in 77 and then bishops in 88, why would you get ordained in SSPX, or be a parishioner there ?Anyway, I'll never ""become a canonical society"", I'm a catholic faithful, only member of the Church, the one with Pope Francis and Father David Pagliarani, of which Paul VI and Lefebvre were members, and before them Pope Liberius and Saint Athanasius."
1egtnha,Who are the MC-SSPX,lfvzm7j,Smooth_Ad_5775,1,So is the only way the crisis would be resolved is if the liturgical reforms were revoked?
1egtnha,Who are the MC-SSPX,lfw0djs,craft00n,1,"I don't know, I'm not a canonist nor an ecclesiologist. God will find a way, as he already did in the Arian crisis and the three Pope's schism. Btw, any canonist would tell you that the  great schism resolution was canonically illegal (they used Conciliarism, a heretic theological position which was already disqualified at the time), so you can see that God can really use absolutely anything in order to guide his Church."
1egtnha,Who are the MC-SSPX,lfzuwe1,Araedya,1,The SSPX were almost regularized back in 2017 but Rome did a complete about-face at the last moment and the entire thing fell through. They (the SSPX) were willing to agree to a personal prelature allowing them to continue as they are while still being allowed to question certain aspects of the council and the liturgical reform. This was their [doctrinal preamble](http://www.archbishoplefebvre.com/uploads/1/0/3/2/10321570/_bishop_fellays_doctrinal_preamble.pdf)that they submitted to Rome back in 2012 if you want an idea of what they‚Äôre looking for. It‚Äôs pretty reasonable imo.
1egtnha,Who are the MC-SSPX,lfzxdpw,Smooth_Ad_5775,2,Dang. Thank you for the preamble.
1egtnha,Who are the MC-SSPX,lg2e4o5,craft00n,1,"To my knowledge, it's the SSPX who turned the offer down because a few old and really wise priests said ""Well, personal prelature, the Pope can wipe us from the surface of the earth in one stroke of pen"". It's my uncle, SSPX priest, who told me so. For what I'm able to understand, SSPX wouldn't go back under direct papal institutional authority without strong theological evolutions on Rome's side."
1egtnha,Who are the MC-SSPX,lg2v9mu,Araedya,1,I‚Äôve heard the talks w/ Rome generated some internal strife but from what I understand they were all set to be regularized until cardinal muller changed the terms of the (doctrinal) agreement at the last minute which caused the sspx to walk. There‚Äôs probably better sources but this [interview](https://fsspx.news/en/news/bishop-fellay-interview-are-disturbing-factor-church-19871)with Bishop Fellay touches on some of it towards the end there.

The other sacraments are done illicitly due to them not having an actual Canonical status. Your best bet is to contact your local bishop on the matter. Obviously, talking to someone who attends the sspx or an sspx priest is going to have bias towards their position(I was raised in the sspx but left a year ago after realizing there were issues)"
1ea9a24,Are sspx priests suspended?,lekaek4,Smooth_Ad_5775,2,His idea that the SSPX aren‚Äôt suspended is based on the idea that a suspended priest cannot have facilities. Where can I find this idea in canon law or Vatican sources?

1ea9a24,Are sspx priests suspended?,lfgat93,Cathain78,1,"As someone with the opposite experience, raised in the Novus Ordo and started attending  SSPX masses a year ago, I feel you are being rather uncharitable. And talking to an SSPX priest will mean they will give a biased answer? Well they will hold a certain opinion of course. Talking to your Novus Ordo parish priest will also likely reveal his own bias. And if it was anything like mine, worse than just that. At least talking to my SSPX priest I don‚Äôt have to worry about listening to roaring heresy nor his complete disregard for ‚Äúthe rules‚Äù. In truth, he seemed far more errant than any society priest I‚Äôve encountered."
1ea9a24,Are sspx priests suspended?,lekrvvg,Araedya,2,"I think for the specific questions you are asking you might want to have an actual conversation with an SSPX priest. In my (limited) experience, they are used to questions and happy to answer them. My logic would be that if Pope Francis has given the SSPX permission to freely ordain priests without the local ordinary‚Äôs permission then the ordinations would be licit and not subject to the automatic suspension. I would assume they would follow the usual protocols regarding paperwork. Furthermore the fact he extended the additional faculties for confession/marriage puts them in an even more ‚Äúregular‚Äù situation. I think that if you want to attend the SSPX you‚Äôll have to get used to the fact their situation is unusual and complicated."
1ea9a24,Are sspx priests suspended?,lenqu2j,Huge-Explanation-358,1,Well just go to Mass and talk to them afterwards
1ea9a24,Are sspx priests suspended?,ler65zc,Naft_814,2,"I would have to disagree with Fr. Z on some of his points. I think an important thing to note about the SSPX is that while they will cooperate with some things with Rome, they will only be obedient to what they see as reasonable. For example, if the local bishop does not give permission to the sspx to ordain or build a chapel in his diocese they will do it anyway. (As far as I can see the only source regarding the sspx being able to ordain without permission is from Bishop Fellay. I'm going to have to see actual proof to actually believe thats the case) Those who promote the sspx will use the excommunications being lifted or faculties being granted as a way to act as if the sspx is totally fine, but they seem to ignore Pope Benedict XVI saying they had no Canonical status and that Pope Francis stated he's given faculties for the pastoral benefit of those who attend the sspx chapels. But here's the thing, the sspx bishops are getting older. They will be consecrating bishops sometime in the future, even if they have to do so without permission from Rome. Doing this it can be predicted that they will once again be excommunicated and the faculties of their priests revoked. It's better to stay away instead of try and get involved with the sspx.I should mention some stuff that you're probably never going to hear about or read in a blog because many people outside of the sspx probably don't know these things. Many of these things were my own opinions as well until recently. Those who attend the sspx view the sspx as holding the truth. The sspx views the Novus Ordo as, although valid, a spiritual poison and an offense against God. In their spiritual Warfare book, participating in the Novus Ordo is listed as a sin. If for some reason you are to attend a Novus Ordo Mass for a wedding or funeral you are not to participate and not to receive Communion. In the sspx we really have no actual connection with the Pope or our local bishop, sure we pray for them, but we really just see them as modernists and we don't really abide by their authority unless we think it's reasonable. We pretty much view the sspx bishops as our bishops (they're not, your local bishop is your bishop). Other Latin Mass communities like the fssp and institute are to be avoided, the sspx does not consider them Traditional Catholics. If someone were to leave the sspx to attend a Diocesan chapel or FSSP/institute (and you're no longer at least a friend of the sspx) you will be viewed as putting your soul in grave danger (yes, I was told this by a family member after I told them I left) this is common as many people have gone through similar things with their families if they leave the sspx"
1ea9a24,Are sspx priests suspended?,lfhqzbl,Naft_814,1,"With all due respect I'm not sure how you thought my comment was uncharitable. Please also note that I advised him to talk to his local bishop on the matter since he is trying to find information on this, his local bishop will be the best reference. I'm well aware of the issues that are going on in the Church and I'm well aware of modernist takes coming from various laymen and clergy. Please dont think that because I left the sspx it means I therefore think Novus Ordo clergy can do no wrong, heresy should be purged out of the Church and corrections should be made. However, this doesn't therefore mean that talking to a sspx priest and taking the sspx position is justifiable as the sspx promotes schismatic views. I'm not sure if you've read my other comments on this post but myself as well as others face scrutiny if we no longer attend the sspx, our family and friends act as if we've pretty much left the Faith. It's also pretty well known that you'll receive scrutiny if you leave. Many people either leave quietly or they have a hard time leaving out of fear. Though it's not said, it's believed that the sspx is the holder of the true Faith and the trustworthy authority, or at least is the correct path to take. In fact, the first time I stopped attending the sspx and went to the local TLM for my Holy Day of Obligation, I was a nervous wreck because we're told that you shouldn't be going to other TLM groups either. There are serious issues of schism that are ignored because you may be less likely to hear heresy. But the thing is, schism is a lot easier to fall into."

I understand the confusion people have and I know those who adhere to the sspx think they are doing the right thing (after all I was an adherent for nearly 20 years myself and used to share many of those opinions myself) However, my loyalty is to Christ, His Church, and His Vicar and because of that I can no longer defend the sspx as they are in their current situation.

1ea9a24,Are sspx priests suspended?,les0pf1,Smooth_Ad_5775,1,What do you think about the argument that the priests aren‚Äôt suspended as long as their names are communicated to the bishop (since pope Francis gave permission to ordain priests to the bishop without talking to the ordinary first and the only reason why the priests are suspended was because of a lack of dimissorial letters)? I think it was presented in the first link but I want to go into that argument a little bit more:. Thank you
1ea9a24,Are sspx priests suspended?,lf0i3ku,None,3,"I see what you mean, but TLM from ex Ecclesia Dei communities doesn't solve the state of necessity issue, since they don't have a good/clear position over some modern doctrinal issues; either they avoid doctrinal problems like religious freedom of Vatican II by not addressing it, or they even go as far as supporting it; it's not only a Mass issue, modernism is also about views on the modernist crisis, on religious freedom etc; I know the ex Ecclesia Dei communities pretty well (I'm a scout chief at a FSSP parish) and I think if one goes to their Masses too often, he risks being influenced by their standpoints"
1ea9a24,Are sspx priests suspended?,lessb5o,Naft_814,1,"I don't know of any documents allowing the sspx to do that. Bishop Fellay said he received a letter from Pope Francis but as far as I know there is no actual documentation of that. If there is actual documentation stating that they are indeed given permission then id be more than happy to see it. Otherwise, the suspension comes from session 23 chapter 8 of the Council of Trent stating: ""Ordinations of sacred orders shall be celebrated publicly, at the time appointed by law, and in the cathedral churches, in the presence of the canons of that church, who are to be invited for that purpose; but, if they are celebrated in some other place of the diocese, in the presence of the clergy of the place; the principal church being always, as far as possible, made use of. But each one shall be ordained by his own bishop. And if any one ask to be promoted by another bishop, this shall by no means be allowed him, even under the pretext of any general or special rescript or privilege whatsoever, even at the appointed times; unless his probity and morals be recommended by the testimony of his own Ordinary; otherwise, he who ordains him shall be suspended from conferring orders during a year, and he who has been ordained shall be suspended from exercising the orders which he has received, for as long a period as shall seem expedient to his own Ordinary."" The sspx seminary in Germany was explicitly denied permission to ordain yet they did it anyway. https://catholicradar.com/2024/06/28/bishop-voderholzer-prohibits-ordinations-of-pius-brothers-in-zaitzkofen/"

1e8z7gd,What constitutes as a ‚Äújust cause‚Äù for attending masses by suspended priests?,leca1c2,Jerailu,2,It's literally in the name. A just cause is a cause deemed...just. Like for instance in times of persecutions or if you cannot reasonably deny a wedding/funeral invitation (wich is frankly everytime.

1e8z7gd,What constitutes as a ‚Äújust cause‚Äù for attending masses by suspended priests?,legpaxq,MitthrawnuruodoVCR,2,"I am more or less 'party line' SSPX.Ultimately if you think the Novus Ordo Mass or problem areas of Vatican 2 (Collegiality, Religious LIberty, Ecumenism) are defensible, then I will be the first to tell you that the SSPX argument fails. Go to Diocesan TLM or NO. they are both of the same beliefs.the individuals that believe Jp2 was worthy of canonization, and that reverent NOMs are pleasing to God, have no business going to SSPX. yet many do because they haven't studied hard enough, or they take to heart and their ultimate conclusions what the new conciliar church teaches about new religious liberty.It is kind of hilarious when you see Orthodox, protestants and Muslims treated with more respect then the SSPX.Anyway, our battle is not about preference (smells and bells) it is because we clearly see the things in the NOM and V2 are not of the faith. I resist because I must and Faith demands it.If you want to learn more listen to Fr Hesse. Not going to say he is always 100% right, but he was wise, spot on and is very easy to listen to: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y28501DJ3Mk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y28501DJ3Mk)"
1e8z7gd,What constitutes as a ‚Äújust cause‚Äù for attending masses by suspended priests?,lf45gvx,Brendanjfinnegan,1,It generally has to do witha person:who wishes to attend said mass not having a mass nearby (more than 15 miles away) or having  any moral apprehension against attending (scandalous behavior by a priest minister or congregant).

If you're talking about Benedict the XVIth, since his papacy, pope Francis gave bishop Fellay a licence to ordain without dimissorial letters from the Ordinary and thus possibly incardinate priests in the name of the SSPX.Bernard Fellay made it public in an interview awhile ago. So canonically speaking you either believe he's lying or you have to admits they're licit.I don't agree with the SSPX and usually don't go there to church because I do not agree with them but when I'm invited and stuff I do take communion here for these reasons."

1e8z7gd,What constitutes as a ‚Äújust cause‚Äù for attending masses by suspended priests?,ledbbn9,Jerailu,3,"Well it's just logic.1: The SSPX priests were suspended because their ordinations weren't done with dimissorials letters2: The pope give verbally an indult so that they are not concerned with the need to conduct ordinations while providing dimissorials letters3: The cause for the suspension a divinis of said priests does not exists4: Therefore the suspension is not in effect anymoreDoesn't it seems logical to you?

1e79q0o,Thoughts on Protestants ,ldyxm7m,None,10,"The SSPX holds the same position that the Church has always held, until recent years. Protestantism was founded as a heresy. It is a false religion. There is no salvation outside of the Catholic Church; however, this does not mean that a person cannot have salvation if they are not physically a part of the Church. St Thomas teaches us, in his articles on heresy within the Summa Theologica, that a heretic is someone who starts or follows false or new opinions. By being followers of a heresy, known to them or not, they are defined as heretics, which St Thomas says is a form of unbelief. Knowledge of truth must come before belief, and belief before faith. Protestants do not know or accept the truths that the Catholic Church has known and teaches; therefore, they cannot have belief or cultivate true faith. We do not have a ‚Äúlower view‚Äù, we have a reasonable view."

Humans respond to incentives, and it's especially hard to fund media in a way that doesn't create perverse incentives (eg state funded media will be less critical of the state that funds it, Alex Jones panders to the crazy people that make up most of his audience and buys the products he advertises)."

Though I do not accept the legitimacy of the ‚Äò83 code (for it is my opinion that John Paul II and Ratzinger were heretics, who are barred from the papacy by the divine law), this provision is also found in the ‚Äò83 code, albeit more vaguely and apparently less generously.

1e5h1k9,Does the SSPX reject Vatican 2,ldss7p5,MarcellusFaber,1,"Canon 2261 states that the laity can approach undeclared tolerated excommunicates for the Sacraments for any just cause (the commentaries, such as of Hyland & Dom Augustine, state the bar is very low for this; wishing to communicate more frequently is given as an example of just cause). Canon 2284 extends this provision to suspended priests. From your point of view, SSPX priests are suspended, hence canon 2284 applies to them and they can be approached for the Sacraments. These canons are easily accessible in the English translation of Edward Peters, Dom Augustine‚Äôs commentary (on archive.org), and in Hyland‚Äôs dissertation on excommunication (also on archive.org).Yes, I do believe that the putative Popes from Paul VI onwards have been anti-Popes. Some examples of their publicly professed heresies are religious liberty, teaching that the Jews are not a cursed people, which is the common teaching of the Fathers, collegiality, and latitudinarism (or religious indifferentism), which leads to their enthusiastic promotion of false oecumenism and communicatio in sacris with non-Catholics."

My next argument would be to invoke cessation of law concerning the laws that require dismissorial letters, papal mandate, jurisdiction given in writing, etc. since the laity need the Sacraments and laws that would prevent our having the Sacraments due to the situation would have become harmful. This is from the idea that western orders conferred through the new rites are doubtful, however. As to the argument from canons 2261 and 2284, it doesn‚Äôt matter whether there is a priest in good standing more readily available; the law still allows one to go to the suspended or excommunicated priest."

1e5h1k9,Does the SSPX reject Vatican 2,lednb3l,MarcellusFaber,1,"I wouldn‚Äôt say that they certainly are, but doubtful Sacraments have to be avoided. The problem is that the rites were changed by Paul VI. My simple line of thought is that, while technically possible, it is not likely that a Modernist anti-Pope would promulgate valid rites. The rather more complicated arguments, which I‚Äôll admit I don‚Äôt understand that well, involve the lack of a moral union between the matter and form of episcopal consecration. Comparisons to the controversy concerning Anglican orders have also been made.It is worth noting that it is utterly impossible for a true Pope to promulgate invalid or harmful rites or disciplines due to the Church‚Äôs disciplinary infallibility."
1e5h1k9,Does the SSPX reject Vatican 2,leduwfu,Smooth_Ad_5775,1,I am not a sede so I will believe that the ordinations are valid but thank you for telling me.

1e5h1k9,Does the SSPX reject Vatican 2,lef9gut,MarcellusFaber,1,"Yes, they will baptise and confirm you conditionally if there is a good reason, which in your case there is.

1e5h1k9,Does the SSPX reject Vatican 2,lefx54s,MarcellusFaber,1,"Because they are not diocesan bishops. The authority of a bishop does not come from his orders, but rather from his ordinary jurisdiction, which the SSPX bishops do not have, nor make any claim of having."

We are in a very Christian community with many Catholic Churches but they are all N.O.  Several have altar girls. One had country western songs during Mass. A couple of weeks ago, there was a couple of baby baptisms in one parish. The priest made a face and joked about the exorcism in the sacrament of baptism. In N.O., there is only one exorcism. Traditionally, there are three. But this priest acted like the one was something to be embarrassed about and apologize for. Apparently does not understand why there are exorcisms in the sacrament of baptism.  People come to Mass dressed very casually. Sleeveless, strappy tops, slacks, are common for women.

Have a look at Summa Theologica : Saint Thomas refutes the false opinions on the base of the truth, not the other way around.Anyway, as the SSPX legitimacy is a disputed question, it's perfectly valid to ask for answers to the various objections that are given against it.The thing about freedom of speech and freedom of press is that it's liberal freedom.

American capitalism and protestantism flourished on the ""free market"" church system. Oh you don't like your church? You can shop around and just go to ol' pastor Bob next town over who has more X or Y. You can walk down a populated metro area and see 50 different churches, religions, sects, and heresies. This is horrible for people. How confusing and alienating is this? It fosters a divided society. Neighbors have nothing in common with neighbor. Your town is now full of anonymous, fluid nomadic-like individuals who don't see eye to eye on basic things. Also the sspx isn't afraid of dialogue. Sspx priests have mentioned that it's okay to ask questions about the faith. In the apologetic series on YouTube, a priest says it's absolutely rational and *normal* to question the faith. People are sense-oriented rational animals. No one is going to believe a Catholic apologist if the Catholic can't answer real questions like, ""Why is Jesus God?"" Catholics aren't just blind faith believers. Catholicism at its roots is extremely rational and rewards the inquisitive thinker. That's because the truth is rooted in God, (reality is God who is Being itself) who ultimately is simple and can be known by anyone who desires (to an extent, of course, God is incapable of being known fully for He is infinite in measure.)"

1e08o3m,Opposing views?,lcuz4aq,ttpf222,1,"Thank you for all these thoughtful responses! I think you all have already answered my question‚Ä¶. Let me offer a couple of clarifications, and then state what I think is your position, and then please jump in and correct me where I still misunderstand.u/dookiemaster420, I did not intend to make an *ad hominem* attack against SSPX or Catholics. I apologize if that‚Äôs what it sounded like. I try to talk about ideas, not people.u/ryan_unalux, u/MitthrawnuruodoVCR, the reason this has to do with SSPX is the following. My neighbor has suggested that I convert to Catholicism. (My current views don‚Äôt fit within one denomination, but are closest to high-church Anglicanism.) But SSPX has accused most of the Catholic Church of compromising with at least 3 falsehoods:1. the idea that it‚Äôs ok for newer teachings/beliefs to directly contradict older ones,2. the idea that every proposed belief/religion is equally true, and3. the idea that everyone will automatically go to Heaven no matter what.If the SSPX is right ‚Äì if the Catholic Church really has compromised with those 3 falsehoods ‚Äì then if and when I convert, I better make sure to join the SSPX rather than the rest of the Catholic Church.I perceive the SSPX position to be the following:- Each person has a duty to seek God with both his intellect and his will.- As u/Brother_Irenaeus seems to state, it is preferable for a person to be convinced of Catholicism‚Äôs truth first by an act of the will, so that he first believes. Then, his ongoing process of learning will help bring to light in his intellect the doctrines he already knows by an act of the will.- It is understandable that some individuals will need more intellectual exploration first, so that they know what they would be assenting to. However, such intellectual exploration must be subordinated to the good of society. Seeking God with one‚Äôs intellect necessarily involves, at some point, considering ideas opposing Catholicism. But considering anti-Catholic ideas publicly will inevitably result in at least one person believing them. And that damages society.- So, intellectual exploration must occur only within intimate private settings, such as a small discussion group at one‚Äôs parish or coffee shop. And care must be taken that an anti-Catholic idea never be uttered in the hearing of those who haven‚Äôt already heard it. And if it is, then it must be followed with a simple quick explanation of why it‚Äôs wrong and Catholicism is right.- Since public intellectual discussion results in people hearing and possibly believing anti-Catholic ideas, public intellectual discussion is morally wrong in practice.- Such is true even if all participants are sincerely seeking the truth. So, any person who asserts an anti-Catholic idea should be censored.- Therefore, the notion that civil governments must not restrict speech (especially religious speech) is false and harmful. Censorship is a positive good.Is this an accurate portrayal of the SSPX position?"
1e08o3m,Opposing views?,legqs6y,MitthrawnuruodoVCR,1,"you need to get away from 'what is the sspx position'On something like this that has nothing to do with Vatican 2 and the new mass, there is no SSPX position. if you come across it in their materials they are simply re-iterating what the Catholic Church taught for centures or millienia. Everything discussed in this follow up summary post HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SSPX. SSPX is a fraternity of priests made to give Catholic sacraments. If they preach on such subjects to the faithful, or in their seminaries, they are never making up new doctrine of conclusions. They are passing along the teachings of the Church Herself.    You can find support for all this in various encyclicals and other doctrine. I am not an actual expert on this specific topic, but it seems what you stated is what the Catholic Church said and taught consistently. I doubt most the current Roman seminaries teach anything like this now but they would if they were intellectually honest. however put another way, if you agree with this particular logic train, are looking for proper Catholic groups and schools of education that still teach it, no one would be a better candidate then SSPX to seek out for more such spiritual nourishment."
1e08o3m,Opposing views?,lhyoirb,ttpf222,1,"That sounds like the answer is ‚Äúyes‚Äù.

In a generation or two these men will be dead and hopefully their replacements will umpire things.That being said, if you‚Äôre trusting the SSPX to provide the sacraments, then you should fully commit to that trust. The SSPX does put a lot of effort into training priests, and for the most part they wouldn‚Äôt allow someone to administer the sacraments if there was genuine cause for doubt. Ultimately we are still living through a Crisis in the Church, and as lay people we can‚Äôt be reasonably expected to perform canonical investigations into every member of the clergy we come across. We won‚Äôt find ourselves in Hell because we failed to discover a defect of matter in the ordination of the priest who was eventually consecrated as a Bishop.I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if after the Crisis is over the Vatican starts investigations into all of these issues and does what it can to rectify the problem (similar to how once a monastery discover they had been celebrating Mass for 10 years using apple wine, the Vatican stepped in and had every single one of the masses ‚Äúrecelebrated‚Äù and enlisted the rest of the clergy throughout the world to assist), but that‚Äôs pretty much the only entity with the capacity to do so.

1dxzr5c,"""so called"" priests / conditional ordinations, etc.",lc5hdi4,None,2,"The concept is similar to those who receive baptism outside of the Catholic Church, as is my case. If the baptism meets the requirements to be valid then that‚Äôs the end of it but if there is any possible doubt that the requirements were not met then it is usually up to the individual, under the guidance of the SSPX priest, to undergo a conditional baptism. The society priests will not force you to do so. As for priests, there are some doubts to the validity of Novus Ordo ordinations (I won‚Äôt go into detail here), so when a Novus Ordo priest comes to the SSPX, the Society will offer them a conditional ordination if the individual wants it. It is my opinion, if you can call this an opinion, that it is safer to just go with the conditional sacraments so you can be absolutely certain that they were done correctly. I underwent a conditional baptism and a conditional confirmation for this reason. So there can be no doubt."

Thankfully for myself and my family we have found our way into the Catholic church and while there are obvious problems, it has been an immense relief. And to address your statement that the SSPX ""has bee given the ok for the sacraments (?) by the Vatican..."" The SSPX doesn't even make that claim, except for witnessing marriages (with the approval of the local ordinary) and absolution, and THAT privilege was granted only recently by Pope Francis. When pressed, they just go into their word salad about their interpretation around supplied jurisdiction. I've heard it all, and understand it, it's just not logical. It, their claim of supplied jurisdiction, relies on their own judgement that ordinary jurisdiction doesn't apply to them because they said so. Then by extension of that logic, ALL independent ""catholic"" groups have that same jurisdiction, that's chaos. And it's protestant. I have seen so many things over the course my life, but especially over the last 10 years or so, that would strongly suggest that the SSPX has no will to ever enter into full communion with the Catholic Church. The mere suggestion back in 2012 caused a huge split. Any real movement toward legitimacy would cause a massive- and possibly fatal- fracture.

It's in the Catechism of the Crisis in the Church book by Angelus Press as well as heavily discussed in their podcasts and videos ad nauseum. A quick Google search would show you this. Multiple Vatican officials have publicly said that the sspx fulfills one's Sunday obligation and that they are not in schism. Also, if the sspx were really outside of the church then they would not even be considered in ""irregular communion."" Pope Francis would have crushed their legitimacy by now. The whole crisis in the church today is complex and unfortunately, to the detriment of souls, extremely difficult. At the end of the day, there's an obvious rupture of orthodoxy within the church. If it's not clear to you, I have nothing to say. There are oceans of ink already spilled detailing the errors of V2 and its fruits.

Mas a Igreja n√£o prevalecer√° como diz Mateus 16:18- Reconheces o CV II como um v√°lido Conc√≠lio Ecum√©nico? *(podes, √† vontade, julgar que houve uma m√° implementa√ß√£o de algumas coisas)*- Reconheces Novus Ordo como um tipo v√°lido, leg√≠timo e n√£o errado de Missa?- Reconheces todos os Papas desde o Vaticano II como leg√≠timos Papas?"

1dxzetf,Position on Catechism,ld4xy5t,kawaqcosta,1,"O surgimento do *Novus Ordo* n√£o pode ser comparado com a evolu√ß√£o org√¢nica da liturgia cat√≥lica, uma vez que ele foi um rito inteiramente fabricado e mudou radicalmente a liturgia anterior. Nunca houve nada semelhante na hist√≥ria da Igreja, pois todos os ritos evolu√≠ram org√¢nica e gradualmente. A pr√≥pria possibilidade de tal coisa ocorrer nunca foi concebida anteriormente. O Cardeal Ratzinger, no pref√°cio da obra *A Reforma da Liturgia Romana* de Mons. Klaus Gamber, afirmou o seguinte:> O que ocorreu ap√≥s o Conc√≠lio √© algo completamente distinto: no lugar de uma liturgia fruto de um desenvolvimento cont√≠nuo, introduziu-se uma liturgia fabricada. Escapou-se de um processo de crescimento e de devir para entrar em outro de fabrica√ß√£o. N√£o se quis continuar o devir e o amadurecimento org√¢nico do que existiu durante s√©culos. Foi substitu√≠do, como se fosse uma produ√ß√£o industrial, por uma fabrica√ß√£o que √© um produto banal do momento. \[...\]Noutros tempos, qualquer afirma√ß√£o relativa a uma verdade de f√© que fosse imprecisa e que desse margem para compreens√µes heterodoxas seria condenada como err√¥nea e perigosa (n√£o necessariamente her√©tica), especialmente em contextos onde falta de clareza pode minar o dogma da f√©.A nova missa est√° numa situa√ß√£o an√°loga a essa. As defici√™ncias e ambiguidades da nova liturgia, n√£o expressando precisamente a f√© cat√≥lica na presen√ßa real e no sacrif√≠cio, s√£o falhas graves. Noutros tempos algo semelhante a isso na liturgia seria condenado pela Santa S√©, que j√° condenou coisas muito menos graves que isso. S√£o raz√µes suficientes para justificar a mal√≠cia inerente do *Novus* *Ordo*, independente de ser bem ou mal celebrado.Me restrinjo a dizer isso sobre o *Novus Ordo*, n√£o tenho interesse em prosseguir essa discuss√£o. Se voc√™ quer buscar a verdade quanto a esse assunto, estude. Discuss√µes online s√£o geralmente in√∫teis e infrutuosas. Mas perceba que as raz√µes pelas quais os tradicionalistas sustentam suas posi√ß√µes n√£o s√£o infundadas e levianas, s√£o raz√µes s√©rias, embora um ou outro argumento possa estar errado.

1du6t4f,What do you think about the death penalty?,lbhnoc1,asimovsdog,3,"John 8:7 were Pharisees who were trying to stone a woman over prostitution. Mosaic law forbids prostitution, but doesn't put a death penalty on it. Romans 13:3 pretty much clears it. Jesus himself said that, for some people, it would be better for them to be thrown into a lake than to mislead other people into heresy. The value of the soul is infinitely larger than the value of a body. Even through death, some people could be saved - and the death could be used by God as penance for the sins, in case the soul is saved via contrition. Others will be condemned to hell, but if we let them live longer, they aren't going to repent and accumulate more and more sins and drag other people into hell.I approve of the death penalty, but only if it's done by Catholic morals and with severe prudence. The Inquisition did it right, they did burn heretics at the stake, but only after severe prudence, which was a lot better than medieval mobs burning people for ""witchcraft""."

I‚Äôve been to Masses held around spaghetti dinner tables and the Host was leavened wheat bread from the grocery store. It‚Äôs not until literally right now that I realized I‚Äôve eaten the same bread at that table for dinner and not sure if that was consecrated as well, because it was on the table for dinner. But does the Sacrament confect on all valid matter in the vicinity or just what‚Äôs intended to be consecrated?Bringing kids and the laity up around the table altar for the Our Father, teaching heresy and error from the pulpit, guitar Masses‚Ä¶I‚Äôve seen it all. Yoga with the priest outside of Mass, endorsing actual factual contraception, giving Communion to the unrepentant sinners in public scandal (thank you, Father College once again).The only thing I‚Äôve haven‚Äôt seen with my own eyes is liturgical dance, although I know it exists around here, or did, because my cousin keeps saying I should watch her routine that brought people to tears.Edit: People who love the NO love it because it can be catered to them. Which is, by definition, ripe for abuse. They want to feel involved. The parishioners want to feel loved and hugged. They don‚Äôt see how robotic it is to, in the name of transparency, turn all the missalette pages in unison to the point page-turning becomes audible, despite the fact the same reading is in the vernacular. They don‚Äôt care about following the rubrics because it would make the Mass less about their needs and more about God. You can‚Äôt serve both. This is also why people who hate the TLM think it‚Äôs purely about the language (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt speak Latin‚Äù). The reformers did a damn good jobmaking people forget ‚Äîor never learn‚Äî that the NO is not the vernacular TLM. The NO is to the TLM what a Whopper is to a fine dark chocolate truffle."

1dpf9e5,Why do some Catholics think that the Traditional Latin Mass is just a Tradition from the Middle Ages?,lahkfuc,Cathain78,10,"First of all, you can assume with a high degree of probability that they haven‚Äôt actually done any serious research themselves to reach this conclusion. They are just repeating it as read from someone else.The motivation, I would guess, is basically an attempt to push back against the fact that the New Mass is an innovation dating back 60 years. So they will try to put the TLM on a similar footing by saying it only goes back to the Middle Ages, or to the Council of Trent, or even that it was constantly being changed right up until Pope Pius XII. The inference is there that it‚Äôs not that old itself, or at one point it was an innovation just like the NOM. Anything to try and make the NOM seem less like the  jarring novelty that it is.Their arguments are not even coherent.For example, they talk about rigidity of the old and the need to move with the times. Then they claim their mass is actually somehow closer to an older form of the mass than the TLM and thus are using antiquity as a pejorative trait for the TLM but somehow a (false) positive selling point for the NOM.In a similar vein, Modernism at its core believes in the need for things to evolve and change over time to better suit the current environment (unfortunately, for them this also applies to radical departures from core beliefs), but when it‚Äôs explained that the TLM gradually and organically evolved over the centuries to become what it is today, they use this as a point of accusation to somehow state that it has been corrupted from its original form.There is no consistency to their arguments because they are arguing in bad faith. Their underlying reason is simply to score points, try to assuage their own underlying doubt, and win the argument at any cost. Things like accuracy and facts all take a very distant second to just appearing to win the argument and silencing their critics."

We don't know at all the impact of genetics on behaviour, because heritability statistics and twin studies are far too shallow as an experimental paradigm.Genetics in humans are correlated with lots of things, but correlation isn't causation, so looking through history or doing demographic stats can't prove much.Sadly, your link is broken.And there's still this problem about the fact that doing some minority report type of segregation won't help with the sanctification of anyone."

An Eastern Catholic rite is indistinguishable from an Orthodox Divine Liturgy, but one is sinful to attend, the other one is not, why? It's the same rite, both are reverent, but one is celebrated by heretics, that's why.The sinfulness also depends on whether the person is aware of what the Novus Ordo represents, how it was created. The Novus Ordo was created by Protestants and leads to Protestantism, it should be boycotted at all costs. We should not communicate there, but it is still okay to passively attend out of charity, i.e. for weddings, funerals or baptisms."

Effectively it's close to the R&R position, but without the ""pope-sifting"" that the SSPX has to do on what to accept and what to reject, they just reject everything that comes out of Rome as dangerous.Then there are sedes who say that the pope definitely IS not the pope, putting their own judgement above the papacy and quoting various saints out of context to support their position (like Fr. Cekada). Then they develop various theories on how this could've happened while preserving their definition of the indefectability of the Church, whether they should elect their own pope (Palmarian Church with ""Pope"" Michael, Conclavism), develop theories on who is and isn't a heretic, theories on whether we should pray ""una cum Papa Francesco"" during Mass and whether it's mortal sin to pray for the pope. It's basically Catholic fundamentalism, all while painting sedevacantism as an ""easy"" alternative to R&R while ignoring the glaring holes in the theory.Sedevacantist priests (from the SSPV) weren't banned from the SSPX in the early years as long as they didn't preach with **certainty** that the pope is not the pope (also the SSPV priests didn't get kicked out because of sedevacantism, but that's another story). It's perfectly fine to have doubts whether the pope is not the pope or to expect that he will be disposed of in the future. It is however wrong to dispose him yourself, because that is effectively conciliarism.The modern SSPX (post 2012) is sliding towards Rome again (see Bp. Williamsons rhetoric on the ""neo-SSPX"") and the SSPX also has taken in a large influx of liberal-ish Novus Ordo Catholics who are already scared of being labeled schismatic. Most people are also not informed on sedevacantist theory.> I think informed discussions with protestants often lead to protestants becoming catholic, so I don't see why the same approach is not used with sedevacantists to bring them into the fold of the Church.Because sedevacantists see the R&R position as stupid. Sedevacantists are fully aware of the SSPX. They think that if you have a pope, you have to obey him in everything he says in order to fulfil the ""submission to the Roman pontiff"" requirement. And that a true pope can never preach heresy because in order to be pope you have to be a Catholic and not a heretic, yada yada. And they might even be right and we are following a fake pope, but until a future pope declares the current one null and void, the sedevacantist theory stays a THEORY, period. Yes, they might be correct that the pope is not the pope, but what should we do in the meantime, while he hasn't been disposed of? In the words of Fr. Gregory Hesse: ""In the Last Judgement, if I did my best to follow the rules in a time of confusion, can God condemn me to hell? No. But if I say that the pope is not the pope, and in the end it turns out that somehow he is the pope? Then I'll have a problem."""

It goes with the territory, because sedevacantism is in itself ""a very daring theory"" to quote Fr. Hesse. It takes a daring sort of a person to hold that position unwaveringly.I sympathize with them sincerely and I'm just as fed up and disgusted with modernism as they are. I don't know if I would call myself a sede, but what I do know is that Rome has been playing fast and loose with doctrine and moral theology for nigh-on 70 years now and I am steering clear of it."

I understand you are not putting forward your argument but rather your best understanding of the general perception, and I appreciate the discussion.For me, I think sedevecantist material I viewed a number of years ago caused me to take the Faith much more seriously and to be informed much more than I otherwise would, but I will admit that it caused despair, which is not good. I just think that if there were more solid defenders of the Faith against sedevacantism coming to the table to have a discussion, then I would not have fallen away for over 12 years.Moreover, I think it is consistent with christian charity to not shut the door on them. I think we should do what we can to invite them back into the fold of the Church, just as we would for fallen away catholics who have gone protestant.

1ddybd7,Why are sedevacantists not treated with the same charity as protestants?,l88q8rz,MarcellusFaber,3,"You seem to think that believing the Holy See to be vacant entails loss of Faith, that such an idea is opposed to the Faith, since the Faith must be defended against it, (i.e. you believe it is heretical), and also that we are outside of the Church.This is nonsense. The definition of heresy is the pertinacious denial or positive doubt of something to be believed with divine and Catholic Faith (something de fide). The denial or doubt must also be direct, meaning that there can be no intermediate steps of reasoning between a proposition and its contradiction with something de fide, so even if you believe that the Sedevacantist position logically leads to the denial of de fide dogma, it cannot be heretical unless it directly contradicts it with no intermediate steps. This is especially true if the person holding the position refuses to accept that their position logically leads to a contradiction. It is worth noting that so-called ‚Äòecclesia-vacantism‚Äô (the idea that there are currently no diocesan bishops or a current hierarchy) which is often conflated with Sedevacantism by Sedes and non-Sedes alike, likely is heretical, if not seriously erroneous. However, this erroneous idea is not inherent to believing the Holy See to be vacant, contrary to what people like Don Tranquillo assert. The response in short is the appointment of Catholic bishops through common error as to the identity of the Pope. Laymann (Confessor to Ferdinand III) also strongly supports this position. I would also ask what your accusation of heresy would be; Ss Robert Bellarmine, Antoninus, Alphonsus de Ligouri, Francis de Sales, Cardinal Newman, Wernz-Vidal, Ballerini, Marato, etc. all say what we do concerning heresy and Papal Office. Of course, there is a minority (composed of John of St Thomas, Cajetan, Suarez, Bouix, Billuart, Lagrange etc.) that opposes the majority position based on bad ecclesiology, and you can hold to their position if you like, but it would be ridiculous to accuse doctors of the Church of heresy for holding the much more straightforward position. The rethinking and blatant twisting of the meaning of the texts we cite by people like Siscoe & Salza is also ridiculous.As to the accusation of schism, those who refuse to submit to a Pope because they reasonably doubt the validity of his election cannot be considered schismatic. This is taught clearly by Wernz-Vidal giving the example of the situation with Urban VI. I also have quotes from other theologians and canonists teaching the same thing. If this were not true, the Great Western Schism (not properly speaking a schism) would have to be considered a lot messier. I would also point out that nobody who professes the Catholic Faith now submits to Francis, so non-Sede Catholics would also be schismatic if we were due to their refusal to submit to Francis, which is now necessary to refuse to practice the Catholic Faith. This is why Schneider slyly changed the cause of schism from the refusal to submit to the Roman Pontiff to the refusal to recognise him in his catechism, which is a novelty not found in the sources. All that said, that is not to say that some Sedes, who might be called sectarian, might be schismatic due to a different reason than their refusal to submit to the man whom you consider Pope. It is possible to become schismatic through refusing communion with other Catholics, and De Lugo states explicitly that this can happen during a period of sede vacante. Sedes like +Sanborn are on very thin ice in this regard."

I agree that ecclesia-vacante would be a heretical position because it implies that the gates of hell prevailed against the Church, but Christ will be with us ""all days, even to the consummation of the world."" \[Matthew 28:20\]I'm sorry if I communicated ambiguously and gave a false impression of what I think because we agree on these points; I was not accusing anyone of heresy in my comment, nor meaning to imply this. I also agree that shismatic would not be a correct accusation on the basis that someone holds the position of sedevacante.I think sedevacantists have a reasonable basis to conclude that Francis is not the Pope, but I am not prepared to make such a conclusion, as I don't think I am in a position to adjudicate this matter. I would liken this to having reason to think someone has committed murder while having not been convicted; I can acknowledge the facts that point to murder and, at the same time, acknowledge that I am in no position to adjudicate the matter. Any conclusion I draw would be tentative and subject to change based on new developments or decisions from those who are poised to adjudicate the matter.I refuse to see myself as not in communion with other catholics and the Church at large, and this is why I give due charity to those holding the sedevacante position, but I think that you are correct that Sanborn is walking a thin line that could possibly be considered schismatic. When I talk about sedes returning into the fold of the Church, I am talking about those who refuse communion with other catholics or the Church at large, not every single sede.Thank you for your thoughtful comment, and I wholeheartedly appreciate this conversation."

1dbvmsi,Incredibly troubling stories,l7txcdd,Piklikl,9,"Unfortunately these kinds of situations are not easily objectively discussed or understood. Kennedy Hall [gave a pretty good writeup](https://meretradition.substack.com/p/father-rostand-abuse-case-the-full) on a case of an accused SSPX priest that I think is very balanced in light of the delicate subject that can be applied to similar situations. The reality is there is no human organization that can be free from the scourges of fallen human nature, but that certainly doesn't excuse it when it happens, especially when those men who commit these grievous sins are supposed to be moral authorities. It also does not absolve us from striving to rid every oragnization we can of the scourge. Sure sexual abuse cases happen at far lower rates in the Catholic Church compared to other organizations, but that again does not excuse the evils committed nor remove any obligation from the leadership to attempt to  eradicate it. Every problem is a leadership problem, and this is certainly one of them. That being said, it's important to remember that allegations are allegations, and many times the people who make them are not of sound mind. The whole Church Militant debacle that you're referring to was clearly a half baked attempt to round up every single person with an axe to grind against the SSPX and roll it all into one article. I spoke with the SSPX District Superior of Asia, Fr. Summers, and he said what he does if there's ever any sort of accusation made against a priest he immediately removes the priest from public ministry and conducts an investigation. If the investigation finds the priest guilty he is dealt with accordingly (I don't recall if this includes handing him over to civil authorities, which I would hope so), but if the investigation exonerates the priest then Fr Summers accompanies the priest and publicly clears him of any wrongdoing and reinstates the priest with a big celebration. I think this is a good strategy that could be used. If you zoom out and look at the issue from a 50,000 ft view, we are still as a society figuring how to best deal with this issue, and as imperfect as it is, the Catholic Church (and by extension the SSPX) is on the forefront of fixing it. While it's saddening the clergy have been forced to do so (instead of being proactive and voluntarily putting into place the best practices before there ever was even an issue), it's better than nothing I suppose."
1dbvmsi,Incredibly troubling stories,l7tpskn,None,15,Church Militant üòÇüòÇ That phony's been exposed time and time again. His weird vendetta against the sspx is founded on slander and misinformation. Are you on his payroll or something?
1dbvmsi,Incredibly troubling stories,l7ukydv,craft00n,9,"Multiple of my family members were victims of abuses. Is SSPX correctly dealing with these issues ? In my opinion no. Is it exclusive to SSPX ? Sadly not at all (I'm a psy student). Is SSPX still the best community of priests to get catechism and mass ? Absolutely yes.SSPX isn't a cult. If you don't trust them with something, you still can trust them for something else. I don't get my political views there, nore my opinion about mental health. But for doctrinal problems, they're (in my opinion) the best."
1dbvmsi,Incredibly troubling stories,l8m05oi,asimovsdog,3,"Okay, let's go through all the ""cases"" in detail:- Fr. Ramon Angles: Kurt Chione, a teacher at St. Marys, reported him to the police as soon as he was aware. The police failed to do their job to investigate. How is the SSPX at fault if the police doesn't do their job?- Fr. Pierre Duverger: isn't even charged with a rape allegation, just charged with imprudent words in the confessional. Not even a police report was filed, and the ""20 victims"" of him also haven't filed any report. Church Militant then cites a document specifying how the PR should deal with Church Militant, insinuating that it describes how to ""cover up"", but that's not what the document said.- Laudenschlager: Was a deacon, fired from a seminary after wanting sexual favors. Is still fired, is now gay and works for Microsoft. He doesn't even associate with the SSPX.- Peter Palmeri: Three priests didn't report his abuse of his children to the police, because they cannot break their confessional seal. Well, it is what it is, but they cannot break their seal.- Fr. Novak: didn't do anything sexual, just a very uncharitable person towards some parishioners- Fr. Philippe Peignot: Allegedly molested a boy and was banned from being around children. Ban was lifted again years later. Only case where I could see a ""coverup"".- James Simmerman: Millionaire who was charged with a rape allegation by a woman. The SSPX priests that knew him vouched for his character during his lawsuit. Given how quickly and easily rape allegations happen against men with money in the US, I can see why the SSPX would defend him. His case was dropped after a settlement. Doesn't mean he's guilty.- Fr. Christophe Roisnel: abused children, was reported to police and in the meantime put into a monastery while the case was going on. Church Militant claims that the SSPX ""hid"" him and the police ""found"" him, which is idiotic, the SSPX does cooperate with the police. Again, there was no ""coverup"", he was sent to a monastery while the investigation was going on.- Kevin Sloniker: was only know for circumcizing himself and was removed from his position as a teacher due to mental instability. He wasn't kept away from children because he wasn't known to molest children. Reported to police and is serving life now.- Fr. Uribe Silviano Bernabe: raped women, now serving life. Again, not the SSPXs fault. - Fr. Fr√©d√©ric Abbet: accused of molesting boys, acquitted because of lack of evidence. He was accompanied by his attorney to make sure it doesn't happen again, sadly, it did happen again, now he is serving life in prison. Again, no fault of the SSPX, they did investigate his case but allowed him to be a teacher because the claims couldn't be verified.- Fr. Stephen Abraham: accused of molesting a boy and then another one 10 years later. Was sent to a monastery after the second case. The PDF you linked is literally grasping at straws regarding ""widespread pedophilia support"". With the exception of Peignot, the entire document is a massive nothingburger. You can read most of these stories in a pro-SSPX or anti-SSPX light and given the reputation of the Church Militant after their lost defamation case, I'll still give the SSPX the benefit of the doubt. Meanwhile, in the mainstream Catholic Church, the priests and bishops aren't disciplined at all."
1dbvmsi,Incredibly troubling stories,l9mfvdx,USAFrenchMexRadTrad,4,"The Church Militant folks jumped aboard the anti-SSPX bandwagon after they received funding from a wealthy FSSP parishioner whose priest was angry with the SSPX for saying people shouldn't go to the FSSP or any diocesan or otherwise Vatican approved (on the condition that the clergy stay quiet about the Modernist crisis) TLM location, because the Modernist bishops have such locations at their mercy.... looks like the SSPX was right. The Modernist bishops are closing TLM locations everywhere.Church Militant made the wealthy donor a producer, so...I had a Facebook conversation about the abuse cases where I was genuinely just asking questions. Not trying to argue or anything. The alleged victim somehow summoned Christine Niles into the conversation, eho proceeded to accuse me of being a collaborator of the SSPX's ""cover up"" and I was kicked out of the discussion, banned from that person's Facebook page before i could respond. Odd.Asfar as credible cases of SSPX clergy carrying out sexual abuse go, I did hear of a priest from Soth America who was already a priest before joining the SSPX. He claimed he was falsely accused of being a sexual predator for being a traditionalist, which happens more than you think.Apparently, it turned out to be true. The SSPX didn't know because there are too many of these cases where Modernist clergy persecute traditionalist leaning priests in a sort of ""boy who cried wolf"" manner. Unless that was another Church Militant invention. Some of the more credible accusations involve sex offender lay people being hired by the SSPX without the SSPX knowing they were sex offenders. It seems that sort of thing happens everywhere in today's society, so it's not surprising it happened to the SSPX. I think it was a janitor at one of their schools, or a lay person abusing his daughters.Not something directly under the SSPX's control when it is endemic throughout society."

So, yes there are politics, but one mustn't fall into the fallacy of saying they're merely that. In hindsight, St. Athanasius fighting the Arian heresy, where he was the only bishop effectively left to combat it and he eventually restored the Church, there were likely some people who dismissed it as mere politics.Not saying you're doing that. But it is something to look out for. I've seen too many Catholics outright dismiss the Modernist crisis as mere politics, and it's concerning to know that it won't be seen as more than merely that by some. This is a very real threat to the faith of Catholics everywhere.As things slide downhill and the Novus Ordo sees its eventual extinction, we have to keep in mind that even though the Gates of Hell won't defeat the Church, they WILL cause alot of damage in their attempt.

They are just doing Catholic things the way Catholics have always done. There is no novelty or going against tradition with the SSPX. There is no 'rebellion' against the authority because no one has the duty to follow a bishop or pope if they are contradicting the faith. Since V2, modernism, and its related theology go against tradition, we have the obligation to reject it and stick to what was always taught by the Church.

Most people make the claim that the SSPX acts in ways that are schismatic (which is certainly true, the SSPX has made it clear that it will deviate from Rome in order not to offend God), and therefore they are schismatic (also this or that Bishop has said something bad about the SSPX, therefore somehow that particular man speaks for the entire Church - when the authorities who actually matter in Rome have never said anything quite as negative).

In this letter, Card Cassidy said that SSPX isn't falling under the scope of oecumenism, because it is not in schism, but only in a complex position in terms of jurisdiction.Another good argument is the fact that the pope gave jurisdiction to all SSPX priests to give the absolution, all around the world, in 2015, meaning that SSPX is indeed under the authority of Rome."

1d8zn8o,Is it licit to make Private Vows of Poverty Chastity and Obedience,l79vrr3,jaqian,6,"There are strict canon laws around living as a religious, (which I forget) but you need to get permission from your bishop. However you could look into Third Orders like the Domicans, Carmelites and Franciscan's (now know as the Secular Franciscans of which I am one). There are also Lay Associations like the Legion of Mary (also a member) etc. What these all have in common is that you live in the world but you are a member of a religious community that meet maybe once a week (LoM) or monthly (Franciscans), follow certain rules and try and conform your life to the Gospels."

You would need a religious rule to follow. Nothing is stopping you from developing private practices, such as poverty, chastity, and obedience. In fact, these are good to practice and we should be practicing them anyways without making vows. (Depending on your state in life)Your vows are only held under pain of sin if officially done in the Church. (There‚Äôs a way better way of explaining that) So, your private practices are not bound. Also, you have a very strict obligation to fulfill your duties within your state in life. Those duties are just as important as your Catholic duties because they work hand-in-hand.  I believe a vow of poverty would prevent you from obtaining income. Here‚Äôs another point to make. Making a vow is not going to convince you to develop yourself fundamentally. You‚Äôre not going to ‚Äúall of a sudden‚Äù come to a spiritual realization or whatever. You need to develop yourself on a fundamental level, building up these virtues that you wish to make vows for and make them a part of your life first. This is why religious have years living as such before making vows. As a layperson, all you need is what I described above. You do not need vows to validate yourself and by not making vows in no way takes away from the merits gained by observing those practices."

Ordaining bishops without pontifical authorisation is a very grave thing to do, they were very preoccupied. It was far more perceived by a defeat by many, including Bishop Lefebvre, because it meant that Rome would not change its mind for decades more. In fact, the parents decided to trust Bshp Lefebvre, but, still today, they are saying that they can't be sure about the fact that it was good or bad, because this decision can only be taken by a Bishop, so only a Bishop can judge the fact that it's good or not."

Attempting to thwart Archbishop Lefebrve‚Äôs mission of forming priests and ensuring that mission continues long after his death is a mark against the men in Rome, not the SSPX."
1d8z9mg,Is there a full video of the 1988 consecration?,l7gix70,Previous-Plan-3876,3,It‚Äôs actually not that grave at all. Or at least it wasn‚Äôt. Up until 1983 you did not need the popes permission to ordain bishops like Archbishop Lefevbre did. It was changed simply to prevent communists from ordaining their own people or forcing the ordination of their own people. In all reality what Archbishop Lefevbre did was completely normal for most of church history. JPII could have quit lying to Lefevbre. Lefevbre was dying and needed bishops for the SSPX. The pope lied for years to the Archbishop saying he would give him bishops. You want to talk about grave issues let‚Äôs talk about the Assisi incident that forced the Archbishop to ensure the survival of the SSPX beyond his own life.

If the ordination didn't happen (which does seem to happen sometimes), then the priest gets properly ordinated. If the ordination already happened, nothing happens. If the SSPX doesn't do it, there is a chance that all the sacraments that that priest dispenses, are invalid. So, seems like a win either way. Ordination is not like baptism, where the form can be quite lacking for it to be valid.It's just like having to check because some NO bishops are doing a garbage job since they lost their faith. Not sure for what reason someone would be against conditional ordination."

1cu8exj,Questions About Catholicism ,l4h25i5,None,5,"Hi!  1. ""the example texts in scripture"" I see your point, don't forget us Caholics recognize 2 complementary sources of Revelation: Holy Scriptures, and Tradition (this theological word is to be understood as in ""customs"", but in the etymological sense of transmission: what was transmitted to us from Christ by the Church he instituted). While most protestants adhere to *sola scriptura*, Scriptures only, no Tradition. Even scriptures were transmited to us through Tradition (from mouth to mouth first, then written, then unified in a single Bible putt together by the Church). Unlike Muslims who believe all truth is contained in the Quran, we believe that Tradition was transmitted partially orally, partially throught liturgy etc., AND with scriptures. ;)  2. ""as people believe the infants will go to limbo if they are not baptised then it seems like adults also would not be able to enter heaven without it."" Well this is what Catholics do believe! Except for baptism of desire (a catechumen who dies willing to get baptism and in certain dispositions) and blood baptism (martyrdom of a cathecumen). Also Catholic theologians believe it's not impossible for an non Catholic baptized person to go to Heaven when he's in state of pure ignorance (for example a guy living in the Amazon forest and could never have heard of the Catholic church.)  3. Depends what you define as ""the Church"". Whatever the Pope says doesn't change what faith is. An important concept to use here is infallibility; a Pope is infallible only in very specific conditions; those conditions weren't met during Vatican II! There are examples in history of Popes preaching material heresy (like pope Liberius, Pope John XXII,...) but never when speaking infallibly. Have a good day, I won't be able to answer this weekend because I'll be doing the Chartres pilgrimage! üôÇ"
1cu8exj,Questions About Catholicism ,l4hohr5,Numbainne47,3,"1. Mary as co redemptrix is getting at the fact that Mary played a role in the greater plan of our salvation through her cooperation as the new eve alongside the new Adam. Through the disobedience of Adam and eve sin came into the world, Through the obedience of the new Adam and eve sin was destroyed. It's important to know that co DOES NOT mean equal to, it means along with, so mary of course is not God and did not save us from our sins in the same way Jesus does. Jesus telling John behold thy mother and telling Mary woman behold thy son is Jesus making Mary the mother of the church and he is referring  to her as woman to connect her to the woman in the prophesy from genises 3. This goes extremely in depth I recommend you check out William albrecht on anything regarding maryology. 2. Baptismal regeneration is extremely abundant in the early church, and the thief on the cross is an examples of Baptism by desire. Water baptism is the ORDINARY means of Baptism, but there are EXTRAORDINARY means like Baptism of desire or Baptism of martyrdom. 3. The church did not change in its dogmatic binding teachings, just because there is heresy in the church doesnt mean it fell, Jesus said it will never happen. look at the arian crisis, heresy spreads but it doesnt mean the gates of hell will prevail, evil attacking the church is nothing new, Jesus said it would happen and it has happened but it won't prevail."
1cu8exj,Questions About Catholicism ,l4iscx1,Any_Coach6428,2,We Catholics believe that we participate in Christ's redeeming work as co-redeemers as Paul did as we see in scripture however Mary does it in a far superior way than any other Christian (quoting Jimmy Akin at the end there).

1cu8exj,Questions About Catholicism ,l4h7nqx,MarcellusFaber,2,"The first thing I would say is that one shouldn‚Äôt treat these questions separately as matters of opinion, but rather go to the root of things. We know that the Catholic Church is the true Church because God has revealed that to us. We know from philosophy that God can neither deceive nor be deceived, so if we receive a message from him, it must be true. We know that we as a race have received public revelation from God since he signed his messages with his signature, which consists of miracles and prophecies. This is what Faith is based on; Faith is the virtue by which we believe those things which God has revealed (so Faith is not some sort of blind trust as moderns say; it is based on evidence). This is the reason that Our Lord worked miracles, to prove that he came from God and that his teaching was true. The pagans and Jews of the early centuries even accepted this since they did not try to dispute that miracles were worked, but rather accused Our Lord of being a magician (there is evidence for this in the Talmud and Origen‚Äôs work ‚ÄòContra Celsum‚Äô in which he quotes Celsus). This cannot be true though since Our Lord both rose from the dead and raised others from the dead, which is something not possible by witchcraft. This relates to Catholicism not only because their is a continuity of doctrine and governance with the Church of the early centuries (for it is the same Church), but also because miracles have been worked as motives of credibility of the Catholic religion up until the present. Ss Francis Xavier and Anthony raised people from the dead, for example, and very many miracles have been recorded at Lourdes and examined in terms of natural science. St Pius X had miracles associated with him also, and all that is not to mention all the Eucharistic miracles and the miracle of the sun at Fatima. If you accept that argument, then you must submit to what the Catholic Church teaches, for God, who is omniscient and omnipotent, preserves Her from error.As to your specific questions:1. Christ is the source of all graces, and since Christ was brought into the world by Mary, there is a sense in which She is the Mediatrix of all graces. It seems also that the idea is quite old with the Fathers of the Church calling Our Lady a ‚Äògo-between‚Äô. The Catholic teaching on this is discussed in Ludwig Ott‚Äôs Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma: https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsofca0000ottl/page/209/mode/1up?view=theater (You will need to make an account, but it doesn‚Äôt cost anything).2. It is Catholic dogma (it is divinely revealed) that baptism, or the desire of it when baptism is impossible, is mediately necessary for salvation (meaning you‚Äôre stuffed if you do not have one of those). See the Council of Trent‚Äôs teaching on baptism. However, one cannot desire something that one does not know, so I cannot see that applying to people who have not come into contact with Catholicism or have no intention of being baptised. The doctrine itself is clear, but exactly how the doctrine applies is disputed. St Thomas teaches that God will send either an angel or a missionary to a person who truly seeks the truth to instruct him in the truths of the Faith, and there were cases of this happening in the New World, and that is also what I hold. Some theologians after the discovery of the New World began speculating that someone could implicitly desire baptism, but I can only see this as rubbish for the reason already stated.3. Following the Second Vatican Council, the Catholic Church, prima facie, no longer appeared to fulfil Her own doctrine about Herself (unity of Faith, infallibility of Oecumenical Councils, dogma can never change, harmful laws or rites impossible for Her to promulgate due to Her disciplinary infallibility, infallible canonisations, etc.). However, it is hardly plausible, considering the Church‚Äôs bold claims about Herself, that the Church could fulfil Her claims about Herself for ~1,960 years and then cease to do so; that is preposterous from the point of view of human probability. These apparent contradictions also do not strike a death blow to the previous proofs mentioned using miracles and prophecies as motives of credibility. For some people, it is enough to end there, however, after much thinking and research, I have concluded that a vacancy of the Holy See is the solution to these difficulties; the apparent contradictions with the doctrines I listed above melt away if one concludes that these changes were not made by Catholic Popes, but rather by men who managed to give the impression to the world of belonging to and being leaders of the Catholic Church when they had in fact abandoned Her and could not therefore represent Her or act on Her behalf. There is superfluous evidence for the Popes from Paul VI onwards (from about 1964 at least) being heretics, and since heretics are not members of the Church, and one cannot be the head of a society without being a member of it, then they cannot be or have been visible heads of the Catholic Church. That is the short explanation, and there are difficulties that arise, but these can be explained if need be."
1cu8exj,Questions About Catholicism ,l8p9c50,asimovsdog,1,"1. Mary as Co-Redemptrix is not a dogma. It is a dogma that she is the Mother of God, as in, both the human and divine nature of God. So, she did have a free will to not birth Jesus, but God also knew that she was going to agree to give birth to Jesus, because God knows all possible futures. Which is why she can be seen as a co-redemptrix because without her will (""I am the Lord's servant"" aka ""I will serve""), Jesus would not have happened. She did however, not redeem the world on Cavalry as Jesus did. The word ""co-redemptrix"" did not appear in the magisterium until the pontificate of Pius XII, and it's not a dogma to not believe in it. 2. Infants in limbo is a theological debate. There are theories and visions that they are in hell but do not suffer any pain, they just cannot see God. Other theories say that God will give them perfect knowledge and then let their free will decide. It's up to God, really, trusting that he is all-just. Jesus is not bound by the sacraments himself and the thief on the cross had the baptism of desire (he couldn't physically get down from the cross to get baptized). We also celebrate the feast of the Holy Innocents, the first babies who were ""baptized by blood"", since they died for Jesus when Herodes killed them. Everyone SHOULD get baptized as soon as possible. But if it isn't physically possible, the desire would suffice. God not only knows what will happen, but he also knows what would happen if the circumstances were different. He knew that if the thief wasn't nailed to the cross, he would obey Jesus and get baptized."
1cu8exj,Questions About Catholicism ,l4i2bxx,Fearless_Medicine_23,3,"Thank you for your reply. I have heard that, although I was told that he meant it as ""be honest about your sin and do not hide it or deny it"".I don't know which he meant, but I believe Taylor Marshall was saying that Protestants believe that sinning doesn't matter - which isn't true. Grace alone does not mean we have liberty to sin.If he did mean it the way you say, then I would definitely say he was wrong and that abusing the grave of God is a grevious sin."
1cu8exj,Questions About Catholicism ,l4hkv5q,Fearless_Medicine_23,1,"Thank you so much for your reply and for such a detailed answer.1. Yes, most Protestants subscribe to Sola Scriptura. Another user who has commented provided a link to a book, so I will read that and see I get on. I will keep in mind Catholic belief in revelation, tradition and scriptures. I suppose it does then raise the question: where do we get the doctrine to follow tradition and revelation?From what I understand, Anglicans believe in scripture and they interpret scripture through the lens of the Church Fathers. As Reformed protestants, we believe that it is a gathering of information and theology through the years and from there we understand what scripture says - I suppose this means that we didn't really know what scripture was saying for 1600 years though üòÇ2. Haha! Well, yes I suppose it is what Catholics believe but it doesn't sit well with me but that is my own issue, nothing much can be done about that. Thank you for explaining regarding the baptism of desire and martyrdom. I have heard Fr Jenkins of the SSPV speak about this, but I suppose I didn't quite get what was really meant about it.3. That is interesting. Is the Newman saying that the Church is unchanged because, even when outwardly it changes eg. Ad orientum, Latin, what the definition of sin is etc, as long as people keep the faith and tradition it will remain?Thank you again! I hope you have a lovely time!"
1cu8exj,Questions About Catholicism ,l4i4gj0,MarcellusFaber,2,"The miracles are worked by Catholics or occur in a Catholic context because God stamps Catholicism, and often certain doctrines of Catholicism, with his approval using them. If he did the same for Protestants, then he would appear to give approval to a false religion. So the fact that Catholics have miracles and Protestants don‚Äôt is proof that Catholicism is true and Protestantism is false. The miracles are still public knowledge and can be investigated by Protestants; that is the point of them, to serve as motives of credibility for everyone. I would also say that miracles do sometimes happen to non-Catholics (the examples I can currently think of are of Jews), but their nature was such that these people felt compelled to convert to Catholicism by them.2. The reason is in the very foundation of Christianity. We are all fallen because we have inherited original sin from our first parents. Original sin brought all sorts of evils into the world, but it also prevents us from spending eternity with God. I haven‚Äôt done the reading to understand the complexities of this, but I think we both know that this is undisputed by the Fathers of the Church etc. The easiest way to look at it is that the son of an alcoholic suffers from his father spending all his wages on drink rather than on food, clothing, and shelter for his son. The son does not deserve the consequences, but they are the natural result of the wickedness of his father.3. No, it does not. To be a Catholic, one must be baptised, publicly profess the Catholic Faith, be subject to the legitimate pastors, especially the Pope, and not have been excluded by legitimate authority. Those Anglo-Catholics do not publicly profess the Catholic Faith, nor would they submit to the Pope if they were convinced he were in fact the Pope as Sedevacantists would (even if we are wrong, we lack pertinacity from the fact that we would submit were we convinced that the current claimant actually held the office).You‚Äôre very welcome for the answer!"
1cu8exj,Questions About Catholicism ,l4i0jey,Fearless_Medicine_23,1,"Thank you for your detailed reply, much appreciated!This is very interesting as we believe as Protestants that miracles were assigned only to the Apostolic era and ceased with the death of John.I understand your argument for the miracles and why they must be of God, and not any form of witchcraft etc, and I wouldn't be so presumptuous to say that they were; however, I struggle with the miracles too as they seem to appear to Roman Catholics and never to Protestants. Would that not defeat the point in proving to folk that the RC Church is the true Church if apparitions and miracles only appear to believing Catholics?1. Thank you for the link! I will give it a read - I must admit, even though I'm not a Catholic I do enjoy a good Catholic book haha.2. That makes sense. But why then would infants be excluded from salvation as they can't know. Sorry, I understand that this may be more of an emotive point, but I struggle with God sending babies to limbo and burying children outside of a cemetery, but adults are sinners but want to be Catholic and be baptised, but can't, are saved?3. Yes, I see your point. If sedevacantist then it removes the barriers. But does that mean, for example, some Anglo-catholics could also be considered Catholics? For example, The Society of St Charles the Martyr?Thank you again üôÇ"
1cu8exj,Questions About Catholicism ,l4kak1z,feelinggravityspull,1,"Anti-Protestant polemics can be just as bad as anti-Catholic polemics. ""Sin boldly"" is often taken out of context, and it doesn't mean we should keep sinning so that God's grace may abound still more. Your understanding is more accurate.Still, even in context, the quote is doctrinally objectionable, as Luther used it in support of his *sola fide* position. Here's the quote in context (in a letter to Melanchthon):>If you are a preacher of mercy, do not preach an imaginary but the true mercy. If the mercy is true, you must therefore bear the true, not an imaginary sin. God does not save those who are only imaginary sinners. Be a sinner, and let your sins be strong (or ‚ÄúSin boldly‚Äù),but let your trust in Christ be stronger, and rejoice in Christ who is the victor over sin, death, and the world. We will commit sins while we are here, for this life is not a place where justice resides. We, however, says Peter (2 Peter 3:13) are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth where justice will reign. **It suffices that through God‚Äôs glory we have recognized the Lamb who takes away the sin of the world. No sin can separate us from Him, even if we were to kill or commit adultery thousands of times each day.** Do you think such an exalted Lamb paid merely a small price with a meager sacrifice for our sins? Pray hard for you are quite a sinner.The bolded portion of the above quote is where I see the doctrinal problem. Mortal sin does, in fact, separate us from God's sanctifying grace, because it is a knowing, deliberate rejection of that grace."
1cu8exj,Questions About Catholicism ,l4jads3,Seriouscat_,2,"Tradition starts with metaphysics. It's not a revelation of an arbitrary decree of God or man, but an understanding of and a description of the very nature of being, truth, love and all creation. It's like someone asked: Where did we get the doctrine to follow gravity so that things could start falling?The difference between Catholicism and Protestantism is that Catholicism sees God as the foundation and source of everything, including the nature of everything, that exists. Protestantism sees God mainly as a lawgiver. Catholicism holds that the intellect of man, like that of angels, is created to behold spiritual things, up to and including God Himself, though not exhaustively. But according to Protestantism, man is only able to grasp God the same way one grasps the laws of his nation and his personal freedoms.Tradition is self-authenticating by nature. When a Protestant reads for example about the Beatitudes, he can only grasp what is said as a phenomenon or an appearance, whereas a Catholic advanced enough is able to grasp the nature or the essence of what's being said. These are the real issues to be grappled with. Things such as papal infallibility or the Immaculate Conception will only begin to make sense in light of the correct foundation."

1cu8exj,Questions About Catholicism ,l4j606s,Seriouscat_,2,"Heaven is not, by definition, a physical place. Neither is it a kind of political asylum granted by God. Heaven is defined by one's knowledge of and love for God. Knowledge means Catholic tradition, of which the Bible is a subset or a cross section. Loving God means obeying that knowledge, which at the same time literally means partaking of the Holy Ghost.In a sense, people who love God above all will be at home in the universe, and secondarily possess a body and exist in a physical place. This is salvation or Heaven. Presence of God, not to the eyes or the senses but to the intellect. People who either dislike or hate or simply preferred to ignore God will be stuck with their choice, face to face with the knowledge that God is most important and most lovable and most true of all there is. And they will hate themselves and everything for this, which is the essence of Hell, which only secondarily means physical existence in a dark, fiery place with others that have chosen the same fate.An unbaptized child can not enter Heaven. Not because someone decrees or ordains it so, but because of the very definition of what Heaven is. But neither will there be Hell for the child, because Hell is the punishing knowledge of having rejected God either directly or through something that represents God. So logically there will be neither glory nor suffering for such children.If you really want to gain deep insight into the nature of these things, study Fr. Garrigou-Lagrange's writings. Then Summa Theologica. Then The Catholic Encyclopedia. Get the definitions straight, get the metaphysical foundation. Ignore ""issues"" and ""commentators"".Born and raised Lutheran and having spent a few decades trying to understand Lutheran doctrine and theology I've concluded that there is no such thing. It's all rhetorical diarrhea with the appearance of profundity here and there."

Even if it is the eternal sacrifice made by Christ on the cross.Valid simply means that the sacrament has been actually performed, not that it was licit or good. So for the NO we say it's valid (since the matter, form and minister are here) but that it leads to heresy, making it bad and dangerous for us, and displeasing to God.  I actually wondered at how balanced this position is when I fully understood it!"
1cpdipi,NO Mass question,l3kejjf,TooEdgy35201,7,"1. Look at how the mass was created. Bugnini (Freemason) along with several protestants were the main authors of it.   You may find comments published by these Protestants who will claim that the NO is a success in ecumenism and that Protestants won't find anything objectionable in it. 2. In certain regions like Germany, the rite is associated with rampant liturgical abuse and heterodoxy. If you are from there the mass is automatically an absolute no-go since it is directly under the heretical diocesan Bishops who follow the ""Synodal Way"". Giving money to them is a sin against the faith."

1cpdipi,NO Mass question,l4ij6pc,Any_Coach6428,1,"The setting of the NO is displeasing to God even if the actual sacrifice is pleasing to Him. I wonder how God felt about all the people who were involved in the torture and death of Jesus even though He was pleased with the sacrifice. And of course though the sacrifice itself was pleasing to God, it still was painful to Him was it not? We get graces through the mass and as Bishop Williamson has stated, the graces in the NO are strangled. Therefore, even if God is pleased by the sacrifice in the NO, the graces He gives are less."
1cpdipi,NO Mass question,l3k3tfn,Cathain78,1,"Thanks for the example. In all honesty I‚Äôm not sure it helps me because now it leads me to wonder if a Black Mass itself does haven‚Äôt intrinsic worth. I mean clearly we know the intent behind it is abhorrent and sinful. But that core part where transubstantiation takes place, if done validly, must still be pleasing to God surely due to the inherent nature of what it is? Regardless of the context in which it is done, Christ‚Äôs sacrifice on Calvary cannot be anything other than pleasing to God. Yes everything else surrounding it - the blasphemy, the wicked intent, etc are going to be especially sinful. But the sacrifice should still be meriltuous because how could there be any possibility that it would ever be displeasing to God? The actual temporal event was actually similar to a Satanic Mass - Christ mocked, blasphemed, humiliated, tortured and put to death.  Is this a way in which even in the midst of the most reprehensible intent, God still gloriously produces good from an evil situation?I guess what I am trying to say is that regardless of the circumstances surrounding any valid Mass, is the core part is in itself always pleasing to God because it is the sacrifice of Christ irrespective of any nonsense or sinful business we surround it with?"

So, from the bishop‚Äôs responses, I guess he is confirming that the New Mass is an insult to God in the way it‚Äôs been stripped out and Protestantised. It‚Äôs an offence that a less pleasing Mass has been used instead of a more pleasing one. It‚Äôs still a valid Mass however. And the sacrifice itself is still pleasing as it must be. But everything else about it is negative.In other words, he seems to back up what I thought - the actions of Christ and his one eternal sacrifice taking place within the Mass are infinitely pleasing to God. The liturgy of the New Mass surrounding it, which is very much ‚Äúwork of human hands‚Äù, not so much."

1cpdipi,NO Mass question,l3k5bd3,None,3,"I understand the distinction you're trying to make, but I think you can't separate the 2; if I offer a great present to someone, but I cover it with wrap paper with horrible insults written all over it at the intention of making you feel horrible, it's gonna be insulting no matter how good the present it. Sure the present is great, but it's not a question of balance between the good done by the present vs the bad done by the insults, since the insults is a proof that the present is nothing but a mockery, which means the present becomes a source of displeasence toward the person who offered it, even if it's itself a source of pleasing for the new owner."

1cpdipi,NO Mass question,l3qtsm9,None,2,"Make sure to come back here if objections come to mind! I think this topic is central in the Church crisis.   Believing the NO Mass is valid is important because otherwise we spiral down to sedevacantism, and the Church has basically failed  Believing it is also a danger to the faith is important, because the NO is partially responsible for the decline of Catholicism, and having a ""weak"" position on the matter means we're not attacking the crisis to the root, which is necessary if we want a revival of Catholicism ;)"

1cms1fi,Valid Confirmation,l33byy9,feelinggravityspull,4,"The ordinary minister of confirmation is the bishop. An ordinary (e.g. a diocesan bishop) can delegate authority for confirmations to a priest in his diocese. As long as the priest has permission to do this, it is canonically regular and sacramentally valid. If a priest attempted to confer confirmation without permission from his ordinary, it would be invalid.SSPX bishops don't have jurisdiction, and therefore they can't authorize their priests to administer confirmation. Instead, their bishops travel the globe to confer the sacraments. Canonically irregular, but unquestionably valid."
1cms1fi,Valid Confirmation,l32k1bk,dbaughmen,4,"It is ‚Äúvalid‚Äù if done right. If it is truly a time of necessity, a Priest is allowed to confirm in emergencies. I‚Äôd still recommend conditional confirmation in the Latin Mass. God bless!"
1cms1fi,Valid Confirmation,l32ptqp,None,4,"It‚Äôs likely valid. I was confirmed in a NO church and it wasn‚Äôt done by a bishop. The Bishop has the authority to delegate if needed. We ended up discovering a doubt regarding my baptism (done in a Protestant church) so I chose to have a conditional baptism, which meant I had to receive a conditional confirmation as well. I don‚Äôt think the SSPX has a rule about priests not doing confirmation. I think they just try to stick to having the Bishop doing it because that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to be done. If your dispositions are correct then waiting the extra time shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. It‚Äôs not ideal but the SSPX is making an effort to confirm more frequently due to the massive amount of people being confirmed. (I think there were around 120 confirmed at my church last year. )"

1cl52et,Boyfriend Wants to Attend Diocesan Mass,l2u5tyn,craft00n,5,"NO is valid. SSPX is clear about that. Just listen to the old Bshp Lefebvre recordings. Anyway, one shouldn't attend to NO, valid or not.You have to speak with him about these issues, about NO being good or not, about the crisis, about Vatican II texts, about what you want for your children.It's not your priest that will choose who you will marry, only you can, because only you know how you want to raise your children.Personally, I would not marry a girl who frequently goes to NO. I could agree with her on passively attending for weddings or baptisms amongst our few NO friends. Diocesan TLM is a bad idea, because homilies may contain grave errors, and this problem extends, in a smaller scale, to all non-SSPX TLM, imho. My positions on the crisis implies that the SSPX is legit, so I would need her to agree with me on that (on 1988, and on the extraordinary jurisdiction). For the rest, whether she likes ICKSP, FSSP, or any other TLM organization, I don't care.My fiance is currently agreeing with me about these important issues, and she doesn't like non-SSPX TLM communities (for me, I like ICKSP because I have a cousin and multiple friends there)."

1cl52et,Boyfriend Wants to Attend Diocesan Mass,l2vnjbx,USAFrenchMexRadTrad,1,"The SSPX stance on the Novus Ordo is that it has had much doctrine removed. Not that it's outright heretical or contains heresy. Your independent chapel may eventually have to join the SSPX once they find themselves unable to find replacement clergy.I remember a place south of Indianapolis that had this happen. Oddly enough, the modesty for clothing was less strict with the independent chapel, as far as how laypeople should dress when they're just out in the world and not attending any liturgical activities. But they had a more hostile stance to the Novus Ordo than the SSPX.The SSPX was more strict about clothing styles recommended to laypeople in their everyday lives, but acknowledges the validity of the Novus Ordo. The SSPX is opposed to diocesan/Vatican approved TLM locations because they don't acknowledge that Latin/Roman rite priests can do the TLM as a right of their priesthood in their rite.So, attending the SSPX with this fianc√© of yours means each of you will have to come to certain understandings of doctrine and the crisis in the Church. While the new rite is more prone to heresy, it is not itself actually heretical.Maybe it won't be such a big jump for you, but don't think some of the positions held at your independent chapel will hold up against SSPX understanding of doctrine and the crisis. The SSPX is the biggest TLM group for good reason. They've held their ground and avoided going over the edge like some independent groups have.That being said, I hope it goes well for you. The SSPX stands as a bastion of traditional understanding of Catholic teaching. Just as St. Athanasius did in his own time, the whole hierarchy having been infected by the heresy of Arianism."

Does any of you pray the Divine mercy chaplet?,kzw19xx,asimovsdog,11,"Dimond is a sede, but he has still very good research on this topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quQb-vyM9CwIn short:- Divine Mercy chaplet is shorter than the rosary. While there is nothing wrong with the prayer theologically, it should NEVER be a replacement for a real rosary (which a lot of people apparently do to ""save time""). That in itself is the deception.- Faustinas diary was on the list of banned (i.e prohibited) books for 50 years. That should make people question her relatively quick approval to sainthood. There are a lot of doubts around Sister Faustinas sainthood and general post-V2 beatifications. These issues are not due to translation errors as JPII claimed.- While the prayers are about Jesus' heart, the first Divine Mercy image does not show Jesus' wounds nor his heart, which is very, very unusual. The wounds were added in a later edition of the image. The image was banned in 1959, because of doubts about the theology of Divine Mercy.- Sister Faustinas visions theologically do not line up with what Jesus would say (such as claiming that Jesus would not judge her or that you could save people at the hour of their death through the chaplet, even though that includes people outside the Church)- I am sceptical towards the Divine Mercy Sunday due to the above reasons, since it reeks of protestant-ish ""Jesus will forgive me anyways"". I cannot judge whether the indulgence is valid or not, if in doubt I'd lean towards ""yes"".I would pick another classical devotion, such as the Brown Scapular, the St. Michael Chaplet, the St. Bridget chaplet the full rosary (all mysteries) before I'd pray the Divine Mercy chaplet."

1bzd2wb,Can a Pope be a Heretic?,kyp3ot8,luke-jr,2,No. The Vatican 1 fathers concluded no pope had ever been a heretic. The Church formally defined that a heretic cannot become pope even if he has universal acceptance. The only theological opinion compatible with Catholic teaching is that a heretic loses office ipso facto (though V1 didn't get to formally defining that case)
1bzd2wb,Can a Pope be a Heretic?,kyqzhfv,asimovsdog,2,"Yes, but that doesn't mean that he automatically loses office, which is the sedevacantist position (their position that a heretic pope automatically loses office relies only on a quote of a medieval pope, which was an opinion because it was seen as ridiculous at the time, but it's not infallible dogma). Nobody can formally declare the pope a heretic and excommunicate him because there is no higher authority on earth, except for a later pope. So popes can be declared heretics in retrospective, but not while they are in office (that would also undermine the office because the pope could've been declared heretic for many different minor reasons). They can practice and preach heresy (as long as it's not ex cathedra, which the Holy Spirit would prevent), but that doesn't mean we should blindly follow that heresy. We should still use our brains. There were too-nationalistic popes, there were popes tempted by Arianism, there were lots of times in history when popes didn't act like they should and caused a scandal. However, you also have to take into account that the pope doesn't act alone and that Popes can change. There are massive lobbies and groups within the Church that would like to control the pope and prayer can change those people."

The Church would not be, for a moment, obliged to listen to him when he begins to teach a doctrine the Church knows to be a false doctrine, and he would cease to be Pope, being deposed by God Himself.If the Pope, for instance, were to say that the belief in God is false, you would not be obliged to believe him, or if he were to deny the rest of the creed, ‚ÄúI believe in Christ,‚Äù etc. The supposition is injurious to the Holy Father in the very idea, but serves to show you the fullness with which the subject has been considered and the ample thought given to every possibility. If he denies any dogma of the Church held by every true believer, he is no more Pope than either you or I; and so in this respect the dogma of infallibility amounts to nothing as an article of temporal government or cover for heresy.(Abp.

1bz82yg,Help on Confirmation/Advice,kyqixxl,None,1,"Sounds like the person to convince is your mother! I'd say there are 2 solutions, first try to tell her that the sacrament itself is much more important than whoever is the godfather, that your brother should pick the rite he loves the most, especially since the new rite is often invalid (just a few weeks I talked to a father who had to receive his confirmation again since he realized the bishop made a ""general confirmation"" instead of giving it individualy). You can also try to tell her that a sacrament is something one cannot receive against his will, he should be the one making the decision. And btw, for confirmation, the confirmed one is the one who choses his godfather anyway.If that doesn't work, I'd say that this is a case where disobedience is necessary, but it'd be sad to have to go through this; try to convince her as much as you can. But no matter what don't let him go to NO sacrament, he'd probably regret it all his life; when I was younger my Mother forced me to serve NO Mass, now I wish I had been strong enough to say no (but I didn't know enough about it)Good luck for you and him!

I don't think it's a good solution for a few reasons, mostly because:  - if you're against the NO for doctrinal reasons (which is my case and the SSPX's), meaning if you think NO is ambiguous about Catholic doctrine, then it would never be ok to participate to it.   - You should talk to an SSPX priest about it but I think receiving a sacrament twice is considered very bad by the church; for example when a Protestant converts, the Church does a whole trial to make sure the baptism wasn't valid before doing an ""under condition baptism"". If receiving a sacrament twice wasn't a problem, the Church wouldn't go through such a complicated process.  - maybe human reasons too ; it's let them believe that you are ready to compromise with your beliefs; which means that if any situation of this type happens again, they'll be able to show you this example to try to make you do the same thing again.   Good luck again, stay brave and charitable and everything should end well!"

For years, i had a bad taste in my mouth because i heard a popular podcaster state that around 5% of Catholic priests are accused of sexual misconduct. He went on to say that if any other organization had those numbers, they'd be banned. It wasn't until years later that i decided to do some research. It turns out that out of all the major companies or organizations i looked up (schools, hospitals, NFL, hollywood, walmart, etc), the Catholic Church has one of the lowest rates of accusations yet gets the most (only?) publicity. I dont know the specifics of SSPX, but everything these days should be researched as well as given the consideration of a pros and cons list to weed out all the propaganda."
1buq5oq,"love the SSPX mass, but confused by all the sex scandals??",kxv6c25,asimovsdog,8,"Stuff happens, the question is whether the SSPX takes better disciplinary measures than the Vatican. Bad people don't change the faith, allegations need to be taken seriously and the people in question removed - but always with due process. The Vatican has barely disciplined priest for abuse, even in admitted cases. The key here is that it will not be solved by allowing priests to marry or women to read Mass.  >Fegan had unveiled what he called a ‚Äúgolden cage‚Äù or ‚Äúgilded prison‚Äù: Notre Dame de Montgardin, a secluded monastery in the Western Alps. ‚ÄúThis is the place where they hide priests who had been molesting children,‚Äù Fegan tells Stuff.  >  >Jake says the clergy‚Äôs handling of the Carlile case will reflect badly on the SSPX leadership. Sending Carlile to Notre-Dame de Montgardin instead of complaining to police, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just letting him off very easily‚Äù.The priest molested a child and was sent to a monastery as a disciplinary measure. In this case, it happened in the sacristy, so nobody can prove what happened unless the priest himself admits to it and turns himself in. So, best thing they can do is send him away. Then the press attacks the SSPX for ""not doing enough"", like okay what should they do, execute him on the spot over an allegation?>The Rev. Laurent Ram√©, the superior of the SSPX priory of Saint-Germain-de-Prin√ßay in which Maillard resided, alerted the police in early summer 2020 after receiving reports of several rapes and sexual assaults.   Shortly after the revelations in 2020, the Lefevbrists ""excluded"" Maillard from the priestly fraternity, according to Jorna. >The superior said the institute also filed a civil suit against Maillard. After the accusations, the priest was sent to the Maison Notre-Dame. Located in the Hautes-Alpes, near Gap, where they welcome priests from the SSPX, some of whom are accused of sexual assault. Shortly after his arrival, Maillard was indicted and then imprisoned.Okay, so he was detained, reported to the police and imprisoned as soon as SSPX authorities knew about rape accusations (the prior cases were reports of minor misdemeanors).  Doesn't really sound like a ""cover-up"" to me. In the other cases, the families knew about the abuse, but didn't alert any SSPX authorities, so why blame the SSPX leadership then? > Kneeling on the wooden prie-dieu, they believe their future lies in how strongly they hold onto their rosary beads. Again, hyperbole like this is why I'm weary of such allegations. Because if you have an axe to grind people are going to just make stuff up. It just reveals that they want to smear the SSPX and make it seem as if the society does nothing."

It may seem like ""what-aboutism"" (eg. sure there's sex scandals in the SSPX, but what about public school teachers/day care/etc?), but I think it's just keeping things in context. Demonstrating the problem of sexual abuse in the SSPX/Catholic Church being smaller relative to other organization should absolutely not be used to excuse us from working as hard as we can to eradicate it. I think as faithful we need to continue to demand accountability from the Church/SSPX and demand that they keep us informed on the policies and procedures they put into place to protect the vulnerable (as well as to protect the priests themselves from unnecessary scandal).

That's my personal bias and I might be wrong. My assumption is that the SSPX is very aware of not ruining their reputation as they are already a minority, therefore they probably care more about avoiding such cases than the official Church.

The only way that I'm aware of getting the SSPX to start saying Mass closer to you is for you to put in the work of organizing the faithful in your local area to make it worth the SSPX's time to have a priest visit closer to you. You can certainly reach out to the closest SSPX priory and ask if they have any specific tips (maybe there's already a group of faithful in your area and they can let you know that).What would probably make the most sense is to move closer to an existing SSPX location. Obviously that's a difficult and multi-year process, but God is not outdone in generosity so you can be assured of recompense for your sacrifices. I think it's good to keep in mind that a value we haven't or at least aren't willing to suffer for is just an opinion. It's not enough to just say that the Faith and the Sacraments are important to us, we must be able to point to concrete actions we have taken to demonstrate that the Faith and Sacraments are important to us. Personally, if I ran the SSPX for a day, I would give a 5 year notice to any location with less than a hundred people (maybe even higher than that), and then close them down.

That one was recently created in 2017 by a woman i believe and i think it was because they were able to rally up enough people (demand). You also need a place for the priest to board so like someone's house. I'd love a closer chapel because we have kids but I don't think that's really possible these days since there are very few priests and they're driving hours and hours to get to the mission chapels. More missions have opened up over the years which is good but I wasn't able to get in a confession since they seemed rushed.

1bpdjn5,Some advice please‚Ä¶,kwvc9gh,4dvocata,5,Feel free not to go to the ecumenical service. Good Friday is NOT a holy day of obligation
1bpdjn5,Some advice please‚Ä¶,kwv7295,Piklikl,5,"It might be worth it to reach out to a priest at the NO parish and ask for help. Even if he is not supportive of the TLM, he most likely would not want you serving in a ceremony you do not want to be a part of (and hopefully will counsel your parents to be more accepting of your choices).   You don't have any control over your parents (or any other people for that matter), you only have control over yourself and the responses you give. Make sure you remain as respectful as possible towards your parents and don't give them any ammunition to use against to (it really helps just to remember to breathe during a heated discussion)."
1bpdjn5,Some advice please‚Ä¶,kwvpnul,Piancol,4,"Your instinct to reject that travesty is clearly right, but being still a minor, I would advise that you don't go against your parents' will in an aggressive manner. If you have to go to the NO to avoid a violent falling out just go but you can compromise with them that you won't participate or serve in any of the ceremonies. And if they try to force you somehow then you can talk to the priest or layperson in charge to tell them that you don't want to do it but you're being forced to. They would certainly not want you to do that Consider that, if you push this too hard on them, you might be burning an otherwise precious bridge that in the future - perhaps not so distant - will serve to also lead your parents to the True Latin Mass. Also, they probably think that you are just being teenage rebellious or that you have been brainwashed by this ""Trad cult"", and your handling of the situation might encourage this false notion in their minds.Try to be meek and humble at heart, like Our Lord Himself told us to be. You don't want this immense treasure to be a wedge betwen you and your parents but instead to be able to lead them to it and to share it with them. They most probably are only trying to protect you from what they perceive as a danger to your soul.You can always offer up this humiliation and submission of your will in reparation for all the sacrileges and abuses that will be committed in this disgraceful ceremonies."
1bpdjn5,Some advice please‚Ä¶,kwv43kv,Skwarex_98,2,Pray to Holy Mother. She will help you make good and holy decisions. When it comes to this strange ceremony... you shouldn't participate in it. How far away from you is the nearest TLM chapel?

It's especially brave from you, who is a minor!Everything has been said here I think, but I'd say, no matter what, do not participate (meaning don't serve Mass etc.), but talking to the NO priest about it might work; if you object your right of conscience I think he would't have choice, especially if he sees that you're determined, he probably won't want to start a scandal.However at it has been said, careful not to break the precious bridge you have with your parents, which might help them one day end up to the TLM.Think of Christ's bravery and patience during his passion, stating the truth but with charity, to find the prudence to do what is right!I had to dealt a few times with ""family dilemna"" over NO Mass, the way I deal with it is showing them that it hurts me not to be able to participate with them, but that I'm doing it out principle and not against them. It makes them much more understanding, especially if you get the chance to explain the rational and morally imperative reasons behind your decision.You'll be in my prayers today!"

1bpdjn5,Some advice please‚Ä¶,kwwb0ko,rathdrummob,-2,"Submission to your parents‚Äô wishes is a tenet of the church. If you truly wish to live a life as an authentic catholic in a traditional way it starts with the basics. Your parents are not demanding that you commit sin. Praying with Protestants is not inherently sinful and doesn‚Äôt deny the faith. It might be distasteful to you but it isn‚Äôt sinful. Humility is the antidote to pride, and if you‚Äôre going to truly embrace a traditional Catholic culture then beware of the prevailing sin of the ‚Äútrad‚Äù community, pride. I know from lifelong experience in myself and many others. Embrace charity and humility as Christ taught. Talk to the priest and then LISTEN to the priest. And pray and be humble. Then it will be possible to experience the joy of a catholic life."
1bpdjn5,Some advice please‚Ä¶,kwval3s,Objective_Ad6378,3,I‚Äôve considered talking to the NO priest and I think I will but such an opportunity for said discussion would likely not occur until after Holy Week.
1bpdjn5,Some advice please‚Ä¶,kwv5n49,Objective_Ad6378,3,"Well thankfully I have multiple choices for TLM, and they are quite easy to get to. The main issue is actually being allowed to leave the house to go to them on Holy Days of obligation."
1bpdjn5,Some advice please‚Ä¶,l3dbun2,dashdum,1,I once saw a very old man sitting in the back of a NO Mass reading from his traditional missal.  I think he was too old to drive to a TLM Mass so he went to the NO Mass and sat in the back and prayed from his traditional missal.
1bpdjn5,Some advice please‚Ä¶,kwweqf5,4dvocata,5,"It would be sinful to willingly participate in the ecumenical service, and therefore your parents commanding you to attend is unjust. I would try to compromise with them to avoid the ‚Äúwalk‚Äù or Good Friday in general. I certainly would firmly refuse to assist in an active role as a server. If it‚Äôs any consolation, Just a few short years left and you‚Äôll be on your own as an adult! Mr. Rathdrum means well but his response isn‚Äôt exactly 100% correct or relevant, imo."
1bpdjn5,Some advice please‚Ä¶,kwy1eej,Piklikl,3,"Put yourself in his shoes: would you want one of the servers in your ceremony to have deep reservations about participating? This is a situation he needs to be aware of sooner rather than later, so you're just going to have to summon the courage to be assertive both with him and your parents (and of course remaining respectful all the while)."
1bpdjn5,Some advice please‚Ä¶,kwv7k6n,Skwarex_98,1,"I think you should tell them WHY you want to go to TLM: because you find it most appropriate to give glory to God in this particular way.

1bpdjn5,Some advice please‚Ä¶,kwva8q0,Objective_Ad6378,2,I have attempted to do that but my parents standpoint seem to be less theological and more ideological. Additionally my mother is fiercely loyal to the NO parish because of how long she has been going their.
1bj5vzk,SSPX and SSPX resistance,kvpgcqb,None,12,"Hi!I'm an SSPX parishoner, but I know the resistance pretty well since one of my closest friends advocates for it.Also I know Avrill√© very well, which is in between the 2.2 years ago (when I didn't know the topic well) I talked with an SSPX priest who told me everything and I thought that his position was very balanced, now I still agree with this position. So basically in 2012 Bishop Fellay (who was superior general of the SSPX) sent a letter to the Vatican asking them if they would accept an agreement based on the letter he sent, where he proclaimed a few things that the SSPX advocates against. Maybe this was just a test, but as soon as the letter became public there was a lot of debates within the SSPX against this letter. Some priest openly criticized the SSPX and were expelled, some left by themselves, saying the SSPX was about to sign a compromising agreement with Rome. After all this turmoil the SSPX ended up not signing the agreement, but the evil was done. However, after seeing the SSPX backed down (and rightly so), ""resistance"" (most of them refuse the word) priests kept saying that the SSPX would sign the agreement, even if it still hasn't more than 10 years, and they started scrutinizing the SSPX and blaming it for any tiny thing, to justify their departure from the SSPX. So what the SSPX priest I talked with a few years ago was basically ""resistance people were right to disagree with the letter (the priest told me he himself was very scared when he saw the letter); however, by condemning the SSPX before it actually signed any agreement, they lacked prudence. Also, we have to trust our superiors as much as we can because they know things we don't, so of course we shouldn't have blind obediance, but we shouldn't condemn them for something they haven't even done yet.""  To answer the example of Vatican II, that's what the resistance says, but as I said I think it's just a way to justify the separation since the SSPX ended up not signing anything compromising.As someone who reads Archbishop Lefebvre a lot, I can tell that the SSPX has kept his very prudence and balanced position, consisting in criticizing the problematic parts of Vatican II whithout calling it formally heretic. My Ecclesia Dei friends keep saying that the SSPX just talks about Vatican II, my resistance friends say the SSPX never talk about it... The common point between them is that they never go to the SSPX and just repeat what they've heard from their priests trying to justify their position!So my conclusion is that when I have to chose between resistance and SSPX I always chose the SSPX, for a few other reasons too; also, I hate the spirit of ""war"" that we have, because it's a big scandal for people outside the Tradition; and I noticed the SSPX barely talks about the resistance, while the resistance keeps talking about the SSPX all the time."

So I think you should show up to the baptism, but not participate in any way (and if they notice, make sure to tell them it's not against them!)Regarding the baptism, the traditional doctrine of the Church was that it is better for a baby to not be baptized than to be baptized but not raised as a Catholic; if they won't take him to Mass every sunday, that'd be a good enough reason to refuse the baptism, for the child's sake.

1bgow90,Should I go to a NO baptism?,kwo1zje,BrodyJerome,1,"Even according to the 1984 code of canon law, Canons 872-874, if the brother is both not practicing the Catholic faith and is in a same-sex ""marriage"", he would not meet the Church's requirements to be a godfather, since he would be required to be an example of the living Faith of the Church. This is the main problem. The second problem, is that for the church to officiate this baptism there should be a well-founded hope that the child would be brought up in the Catholic religion, and this does not seem to be the case. Under these circumstances, in any other time in history, the priest would refuse the baptism.My reccomendation would be to inform the priest where the baptism is going to take place before it happens, so this can be corrected. Knowing NO priests, it is likely that he will not care, or he will find a way around it. If this is the case, I would recommend not attending."
1bgow90,Should I go to a NO baptism?,kvec5uo,Piancol,1,"There are two different issues here (or more). First of all, the actual question in the title: yes you can and should go because it's a valid sacrament in a Catholic church, but furthermore you could be there witnessing that everything is actually done properly so the sacrament IS valid and complete. But this first point could depend a lot on the next point...Second, about your brother and his living situation. Currently he's living in mortal sin and in public scandal and he would certainly not be allowed to be a Godfather by any means, doctrinally, canonically, or even common sense-wise. I know of several relatives and friends that were refused as Godparents in NO parishes because they were living in concubinage, adultery, etc. and your brother's situation, sadly, is even worse than that. Which makes me think that this NO parish is probably one of the worst kind (yeah, there are some worse than others), unless they somehow have been lied to or given incomplete information about the prospective Godfather. In any case, please do report it to the proper authority, anonymously if possible, and if they still go through with him after having all the facts then I would advise you to abstain from participating in that, clearly shameful and most probably sacrilegious travesty.In any case, try to ask your local SSPX priest's advice on this giving him all the necessary information; that's always the best course of action.And pray a lot for your siblings (which I know you most certainly do already), I will remember all of you in my prayers."

The Sunday obligation is Divine Law, not ecclesiastical‚Äîit is that too, but Divine Law trumps Canon Law, as everyone in SSPX knows. You should try to keep the Lords Day holy in the way you can. Maybe that means sneaking off to Mass, if possible, or doing what you can and what a reasonable person would do when that‚Äôs not an option. Don‚Äôt get overly scrupulous. Referencing the canon, the requirement to ‚Äúhear Mass‚Äù may be reasonably suspended if the Mass is unCatholic, illicit, or if you‚Äôre sick or it‚Äôs practically impossible to attend.

Not a way that would convince you, but him. Try to get the reasons why he'd oppose it and be diplomatic about it!As long as you're charitable and faithful, you could even end up being the tool of his conversion, that'd be the most beautiful ending! It's possible, I have met a few families converting through the child. Faith just gives a family such a stronger and deeper sense of unity!So yeah although I don't think it's a moral imperative, it's definitely important for you to continue having Mass every week, you should definitely try to eventualy let them know about, and hopefuly even convert them! If you have reasons to think your father would refuse to drive you there (but btw bringing him to Mass would be a great way for him to discover it!), see if a friend could, or contact the closest parish and ask them if someone could drive you!Good luck!"

It's a shame the system is so slow.That being said, although I'm an SSPX parishoner and supporter, I wouldn't get baptism at the SSPX if I thought they were actually Catholic, so I can't encourage you to something do you would consider bad. I don't think it's true that we are in ""partial communion"" though, whatever this means; either we're outside of the Church or we're not, we can't be half in half out! And I don't think it's possible to argue we're out, otherwise it'd mean Pope Francis allowed schismatics to give confession and marriage!Now to answer your question, except in France where an agreement has been made, the SSPX doesn't want to follow the current canon law regarding marriage (because of its views that are against Tradition) and so it has set up its a community tribunal, which doesn't go through diocesan. Anyway, if you have other questions let me know, if you want I'm in touch with SSPX priests so I can them directly, you both will be in my prayers!"
1b8dxqe,Question Regarding Dissolution of Marriage Process,kttnw8t,Piklikl,2,"The SSPX's  tribunals do work closely the Vatican (some things have to be done by the Pope/Vatican, so things get referred up the chain, at least that's my understanding) , they're not just out doing their own things. There's a chance they might have a shorter line to wait in at the Vatican, so to speak. However, I wouldn't be surprised if the SSPX ends up telling you the same thing your diocesan parish (at least in the timeline). In any case, this is a very technical issue with a lot of moving parts, your best bet is to either contact the SSPX US District Office or get in touch with your local SSPX priest.  You also might be able to get some sort of workaround if you're dead set on getting sacraments at Easter, it would probably involve the two of you taking a public vow to live as brother and sister until the two of you can be validly married in the Church. That way the two of you can get Baptized and receive the Eucharist (and possibly Confirmation), and once the marriage stuff is sorted out, you two can get that taken care of at a later date."
1b8dxqe,Question Regarding Dissolution of Marriage Process,ku2q9dy,joao464,1,"First: dissolution of marriage does not exist. A valid marriage cannot be dissolved. What exists is the declaration that the marriage has always been null and void. If your fianc√© and you were previously married to someone else just civilly, you probably wouldn't even need a long process, as generally a civil (state) marriage is null in itself, you would just need to talk to a valid priest. If you want, call me privately, I have very contacts within the clergy and I can help you."
1b8dxqe,Question Regarding Dissolution of Marriage Process,ku2r10x,joao464,1,"It is worth mentioning that, according to several moral theologians, life in concubinage, or cohabitation between a man and a woman who are not married, even if there is the intention to marry, is an impediment to a future true marriage between the two who live together. This issue must be resolved URGENTLY with a serious and traditional priest. Cohabitation as it is is the occasion for a very serious sin."

Refraining from NO masses is not cult-like due to the sundry reasons given by the sspx based on the facts regarding its inception, its purpose, its content, and its fruits. In addition, it is not cult-like since the sspx only does what the church has always done; that which is not harmful to the faith. They do not innovate nor deviate from tradition or orthodoxy. You claim that one should seek a conservative NO priest which is already almost a contradiction. I've met good NO priests but they are the distant minority in what should almost never be the case. The fact you have to qualify a ""conservative"" priest is telling of the dangers of NO parishes. Going to mass and seeking counsel should not be a gamble, hence the disapprobation of NO masses.

I certainly get the basics, and I even know some of the big words. I‚Äôve been living inside SSPX culture for close to 50 years, SSPX schools in the 70‚Äôs, 80‚Äôs- moving around the country to ‚Äúmass centers‚Äù, arranging my life and career around places where there are SSPX schools‚Ä¶ the blinders just came off and I‚Äôm finally understanding what it means to actually be a Catholic. I‚Äôve seen the society ebb and flow, good years and less good. I have family members who are religious in the SSPX. But I had to leave because my children were losing their faith. There‚Äôs too much bitterness, the faith is too legalistic- way too much ink is spilled justifying themselves, too much doublespeak. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in full communion but‚Ä¶‚Äù only theoretical communion.  Many priests and many faithful would rather criticize what clothes people are wearing or if a woman has a veil than to rejoice that she is a new visitor to the mass. It‚Äôs a bunch of Pollyannas clutching their pearls over cultural stuff that is simply made up. We live today. We have the church that God has given us for this day. There was a Eucharistic procession in downtown Spokane last year with thousands of people attending- not a single word from the priests in Post Falls encouraging the faithful to take part! That demonstrated their commitment to communion with the Catholic Church. They have no intention of regularization. And I do understand that I‚Äôm mainly talking about the US. I was in Europe last summer and they seemed to have a less puritanical sentiment. And I did speak to Fr Pagliarani- not at length or about this topic. I know that they had a superiors meeting after ordinations addressing some of the issues I‚Äôm talking about. If things change for the better maybe I‚Äôd go back, but I got kids to raise, I can‚Äôt jeopardize their faith anymore."

I‚Äôve been doing what I thought was the right thing all along- deferring to the priests as I was raised, now seeing the effects of those decisions, the insistence on attending their mediocre schools, allowing my family to be indoctrinated into their Calvinistic attitudes about culture and ‚Äúthe world‚Äù, the lack of contact with and judgement of the actual Catholic Church and the many, many amazing families that are living their faith and who‚Äôs only sin is not ascribing to the SSPX version of Catholicism‚Ä¶ etc, etc. My adult children finally seeing through all of that and associating all of that negativity and prideful doublespeak with their faith has become an undeniable hurdle that they are having to work through. While I‚Äôm sure that my younger children will have their struggles and doubts, they will at least be different ones, and by working through this for myself, I‚Äôm able to hopefully be of some assistance to all of them in building an internal faith based on joy, charity and peaceful love of God rather than the pharisaical fantasy that they are the among the ‚Äúremainders of True Catholicism‚Äù from some older age that never really existed.

Extreme forms for self-mortification should be discussed with your confessor so you are not doing them with a less than humble piety or the wrong motivation.There are some Catholic organizations , who as a group, all fast and abstain from meat an extra day each week (e.g, Tuesday‚Äôs) with a common prayer intention linked to the fasting."

1b0nahv,How to revamp my prayer life,ksesseg,Piklikl,2,">it can take me upwards of 1-2 hours to get through my nightly prayerI think you might be struggling with scrupulosity. &#x200B;>feeling like I have to redo them several times if they weren‚Äôt just rightYou definitely are struggling with scrupulosity. Morning and night prayers shouldn't take you more than a few minutes each. If you want to spend hours in prayer (a very laudable desire to be sure), then you should drop out of school and join a religious order. You must fulfill your duties of state, which as a student means focusing on your studies. Perhaps your education is a little different from mine but I don't see how someone could do well in school while also spending hours a day in prayer (which again in isolation is not a bad thing, but when it impedes your ability to fulfill your duties of state then it does become a bad thing). A remedy I've heard for scrupulosity when it comes to prayer is to resolve never to repeat a prayer. Say your rosary, and if it's not perfect so be it, offer up the imperfection to God. Most of the time scrupulosity is simply just our pride telling us that we can actually save our souls on our own, it's not the Grace of God that saves us. I recommend you read through the very short book (practically a pamphlet) [Can We Be Saints?](https://www.arlingtonregia.com/legionsaints/cwbs.html) by Frank Duffey. An excellent quote from the book:>Perhaps the following words of Cardinal Newman will tempt us to take a step forward on the road:  ""If you ask me what you are to do in order to be perfect, I say, first do not lie in bed beyond the time of rising; give your first thoughts to God; make a good visit to the Blessed Sacrament; say the Angelus devoutly; eat and drink to God's glory; say the Rosary well; be recollected; keep out bad thoughts; make your evening meditation well; examine yourself daily; go to bed in good time, and you are already perfect.""Also as u/Allstars94 mentioned, getting spiritual direction from a traditional priest is going to be your best bet as well. An in person meeting is better, but I'm sure if you get in touch with your local SSPX chapel they should be able to get an email address of a priest you can chat with."

1b0nahv,How to revamp my prayer life,ksf5cok,anonymous5534,1,"I haven‚Äôt been doing as well as I possibly could, that might be as a result of a couple different factors For 3 nights in a row I‚Äôve neglected to do my nightly prayers in the way that I feel I should and I would be willing to find ways to summarize the prayers in the future but I feel that in penance I should do them the way I intended to for the time (if that makes sense). I‚Äôve just been so burnt out when it comes to prayer and it‚Äôs hard to feel motivated to do it beyond some general prayers where I just talk to God about whatever is on my mind I get tired very easily at night and I feel so burdened by feeling like I need to make up 2-3 hours of basically the same prayer 2-3 times just beats me down, yet I feel like it‚Äôs the sin of acedia if I don‚Äôt. As mentioned I feel guilty and negligent about reducing the prayers I do in thanksgiving to God as well as for others, especially if I feel like I have to make up for prayers that I‚Äôve missed What you mentioned is a common rebuttal I hear to scrupulosity and I have an issue with it personally. I have never said that perfect prayer is what saves me, I don‚Äôt believe that, I don‚Äôt believe that people that don‚Äôt do what I do aren‚Äôt saved or anything like that, but I can find it hard to believe that it is wrong to settle with prayer that you know could be better. I find it hard to feel that it‚Äôs okay to give imperfection to God and just expect everything to be fine and dandy. It‚Äôs almost like scrupulosity can‚Äôt necessarily be helpful but might be harmful but Idk that doesn‚Äôt necessarily feel right either It‚Äôs like scrupulosity puts me in this checkmate of I don‚Äôt know what to do, I can see the arguments for why it‚Äôs right, I can see the arguments for why it‚Äôs wrong, but I can‚Äôt really see wither of them being completely wrong. Even the priest I have been speaking to has said that he doesn‚Äôt necessarily think it‚Äôs wrong but that it‚Äôs exhausting and he‚Äôs rightThat quote from Cardinal Newman kinda makes me concerned because I really struggle to do a lot of even those things. I‚Äôm really worried about how things are gonna end up for me"
1b0nahv,How to revamp my prayer life,ksa6e66,None,2,"Well that's probably why. Do you have sspx nearby? It would be well worth it to travel if possible.

1b0nahv,How to revamp my prayer life,kt0t0jj,Piklikl,1,">I‚Äôve just been so burnt out when it comes to prayerThis is exactly why scrupulosity is bad. Prayer is a good thing, and your unreasonable (personal, subjective) standards are turning it into a bad thing for you. You definitely should talk to a priest about this. Even if he's not the best priest in the world, it's an exercise in humility and obedience to follow his direction. Every virtue is a middle point between two extremes (an excess and a defect). Life is about aiming for that middle point (which is actually closer to one of the extremes, so it's not exactly in the middle); sometimes you find yourself on the defective side of things, sometimes you're on the excessive side. You're clearly on the excessive side of things.I'm not advocating that you give up religion entirely and lapse into being a mediocre Catholic, just that you take 10-15% off the top and steer towards the defective side of things. It might help to think of this as you're trying to walk on the ridgeline of the roof of a good prayer life (walking perfectly on the ridgeline is having a perfect prayer life) . On the excessive side of the ridgeline, you fall off the roof by praying too much. On the defective side of things, you fall off the roof by praying too litte. I'm not encouraging you to pray too little, I'm encouraging you to take a step towards the defective side of things because you're clearly on the excessive side the ridgeline and in danger of falling off the roof entirely. I think you should go for a week or two of saying the most basic and simple prayers (no more than 5 min) for your morning and evening prayers. Nobody went to hell (or purgatory) for spending less than an hour on their night prayers, and you're not some special super sinner who needs to do tons of penance. Swallow your pride, and acknowledge that you're being excessive."

My understanding is ‚Äúparish‚Äù is to only be used for diocesan churches. But someone can correct me on that if I am wrong. And there is still deference for what a local ordinary (bishop) in the diocese for which your church is within says for matters they have the right to change (sorry if that was a weird sentence-I am really tired). For example, in the US if a Holy Day falls on a Saturday or Monday, the you are usually exempt from the obligation under pain of sin (except Christmas-that never transfers). However, your chapel will likely highly encourage the faithful to still attend. Same for Ember Days and vigils that are traditional days of fasting that are no longer observed in Novus Ordo churches. But again, not under pain of sin. I was confused about that for a bit, which is why I bring it up. They recognize there are disciplines which the bishops and the pope have the authority to change, but whether or not it‚Äôs spiritually fruitful is another matter."

God can ask no more than that of us."" - Diary of a Country Priest (George Bernanos)Although neglect of prayer is a sin against the first commandment, it sounds more venial than mortal. Remember sin becomes mortal if it checks these three boxes. (1) grave matter (2) full knowledge, and (3) deliberate consent. It doesn't sound like you're purposefully avoiding prayer. It sounds like you're not in the best place right now. Highly recommend talking to your priest. Discipline is required for prayer and often times demons pull us away.

Joseph prayer, st. Michael prayer, etc.) and put one everywhere (bedside, kitchen table, work desk drawer, wallet, car dashboard, bathroom counter, laminated card duct-taped to shower wall, tape a prayer card to the bathroom mirror where you brush your teeth, etc.). Then as you go about your day you‚Äôll be reminded and can pray a short prayer.  When you shower, you pray the morning offering prayer taped in the shower.  When you are sitting on the toilet you pick up the card on the counter and pray that prayer.  When you go to bed you have a card to read a prayer to your guardian angel.  It may not always be the most reverent but your trying and accomplishing small prayers throughout the day.  You will gain graces to help you expand and continue the short prayers.  Work your way back up to the rosary.I have to admit that when my children were little, and as a stay at home mom, I said a lot of prayers when I had to go to the bathroom.  It was the some of the only times I had relative quiet without someone tugging on my skirt (even if only a minute or two).

Now, if you willingly decide to offer up not watching the game as a personal penance or sacrifice, then that's a different story and would certainly be valuable spiritually, but it's not mandatory.The commandment is to sanctify the Sunday, and after going to Mass at any time and place you can, then you can relax and watch your game which is innocuous fun and God will not hold it against you. The mere fact that you are having a dilemma about this shows already that your priorities are straight and God knows it."

1anol9m,What Should I Do?,krt2gz4,Jerailu,1,"It's in the current code of canon law:CIC83 Can. 917: ¬´One who has received the blessed Eucharist may receive it again on the same day only within a eucharistic celebration in which that person participates, without prejudice to the provision of can. 921¬ß2.¬ª"
1anol9m,What Should I Do?,ks7oo4t,None,1,"Oh ok I didn't know that!However the SSPX follows the 1917 code of canon law, which says the opposite : Nemini liceat sanctissimam Eucharistiam recipere, qui eam aedem die iam receperit, nisi in casibus de quibus in can. 858, ¬ß 1.No one is permitted to receive the most holy Eucharist who has already received it on the same day, except in the cases mentioned in can. 858, ¬ß1."
1anol9m,What Should I Do?,kstwhxo,Jerailu,1,Yeah it's more complicated. I have a St Pius the Xth catechism with me (french edition I'm french) and they quote the new code as normative WHILE giving the advice to follow the old one on things such as fasts etc.It should also be noted that the CIC83 says that more for things such as altar servers serving multiple masses or people going to mass then a funeral and stuff like that.Ofc as the supreme law is the Salvation of all humans souls one always bypass the norm in danger of death or persecution! You see someone trying to break in a tabernacle? Even in mortal sin (ofc with an act of real contrition first) you should try to save the eucharist even if it means consuming all the hosts. A priest died after consecration and one cannot be obtained to finish the mass? A faithful should step in and finish it then distribute holy eucharist etc.That's one of the reasons I'm catholic we can break the shabath when it's needed. Or chose to follow a harsher law when we can.

1anol9m,What Should I Do?,kufxe23,Jerailu,1,Yeah the edition of st Pius the Xth catechism I have is edited by the SSPX's french district mate.And I agree that it's wise in most cases to only take communion once a day!

1ah97n0,Untrue Teachings of Vatican II?,konc847,None,8,"To my understanding, the issue for them is mostly to be **purposely** ""ambiguous, misleading, open to misinterpretation"" is dangerous enough for Vatican II to be problematic. Anything can ambiguous, but being ambiguous in purpose is really bad when the goal is to infliltrate modernist ideas. Taking religious freedom as an example, by enforcing ""religous freedom"" into Catholic countries in the name of Vatican II, recents Popes have proved that this Council is dangerous.However, I think some teachings are untrue *per se* ; I encourage you to read for youself, first *Quanta Cura* (the most famous papal encyclical condemning religious freedom), and then *Dignitatis Humanae* (the Vatican II controversial text about religious freedom) and to see how they contradict each other.Here are the 2 texts:[https://sspx.org/en/quanta-cura](https://sspx.org/en/quanta-cura)[https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist\_councils/ii\_vatican\_council/documents/vat-ii\_decl\_19651207\_dignitatis-humanae\_en.html](https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651207_dignitatis-humanae_en.html)"

1afehm6,Confession without absolution?,ko9veaf,Piklikl,5,"That seems odd. He can‚Äôt give you absolution until you‚Äôve finished confessing all your sins. Then again if you think you got absolution then you can proceed as though you did.Your safest bet is to do as he says: schedule an appointment and then mention the circumstances. There‚Äôs no limit to how many times we can confess the same sin; some spiritual fathers suggest it as an exercise in humility when we can‚Äôt think of any other sins, and a general confession is a confession of all your sins since your last general confession."
1afehm6,Confession without absolution?,ko9xhji,hardeho,6,"If he was telling you you had too many sins to confess for the time allotted, and you needed to make a general confession by appointment, then it wouldn't make sense to absolve the sins you were there to confess. If he gave absolution there, you wouldn't strictly ""need"" to come back for a general confession. Sounds to me like he intended to withhold absolution and have you come back to a more appropriate time.

It's very hard to be a real Catholic. In some cases it's lonelier and dimmer than wherever we were before God's grace led us to the Church. Have faith that you're on the good path and remember that God rewards those who try their hardest to find the truth, to worship Him correctly. Remember that the path to Heaven is narrow - very, very narrow. Although, there's no reason to despair. We have the saints, angels, Mary, and Christ on our side. IMO, it's better to go to the sspx priest for your spiritual problems instead of the internet. They are typically very responsive and incredibly helpful. Ask for his number and develop a relationship with him. Also, diocesan priests, even the traditional ones, can vary wildly from one priest to another, whereas most if not all sspx priests are orthodox, just, wise, and charitable in their offerings.

Fr Sulzen is incredibly experience so you should not pass this up. If you are eligible for confession, thank God. but he may lay out stipulations for returning to the RCC since you were in schism or apostasy. I've heard things that a period of time and whatnot is needed to 'abjure' your schism, etc. but only a well-formed priest can get to the bottom of this for you and Fr Sulzen is fantastic even for SSPX.    ""should I attend Mass at the local diocesan parish? It's pretty modern (it's an international community, so lot's of singing, holding hands etc.).""  personally that would scandalize the hell out of me, I would stay home though I would consider attending confession there as needed.

We understand what is wrong or right based on the traditional ways. Full communion with Rome? Did Jesus really care about the politics of who was who and what was what. No, he taught in a way that people would understand in that time and provided them the means to salvation.The only reason these politics are there is to provide the means to teach people as the generations continue the ways of God and the laws he has shown. The Holy Mother Church has provided religious leaders to look after the structure and if they fault and fail to retain the traditional system, God is still the higher power. No man on earth has the authority to overwrite what God has shown men.All this Communion and apparent defiance of Rome in previous years is just garbage and the only reason you read those sort of things is because the modernists and enlightened want to destroy one of the only true traditional society's left. They can't stand to live their lives knowing that we want Tradition and a way of Religion that God has provided and they haven't had a say in. Similar to history and the division of Church from State.God loves us as children, we get told the ways and understand the consequences of our actions for not obeying him. Faith, Hope, Charity, love of God and our Neighbour, respect for the religion and its ways.

18w3moz,Saints who Disobeyed the Pope,kfvmjkm,apisDei,5,"I think you're asking the wrong question. What you actually want to know is whether resistance to a pope can be justified or what the limits of obedience are. I recommend you study the writings of Dr Peter Kwasniewski and of Dr John Joy (especially his articles at OnePeterFive).To put it shortly, obedience to the pope is obviously not absolute. The pope is not above God (and His law), nor above Tradition.To still answer your question though, I would say that such saints are rare as popes have mostly been orthodox (albeit sinful and ar times even corrupt, sometimes even scandalously so) and their supremacy was not questioned as people were used to absolute monarchs and the topic of the limits of obedience to the pope was simply not relevant (unlike today!).Of course there are examples of resistance to the pope, even in Holy Scripture with St. Paul resisting St. Peter to his face. You already mentioned St. Catherine of Siena. There are also canonised saints who backed anti-popes like St. Vincent Ferrer. I would say that Marcel Lefebvre should (and will) be canonised, also as patron saint of just resistance to superiors. Also, keep in mind that Cardinal Slipyj consecrated bishops against the will of the pope just like Lefebvre. He is not a canonised saint, but unlike the SSPX, he was undisputedly in good standing with the Church."

18voone,Bishop Williamson,kg37g12,Numbainne47,7,"Except they weren't working with him rome was going to give him one bishop except they kept pushing it back and Lefevre was going to die. Lefebvre didn't cause a schism because he never set up competing jurisdictions or rejected the pope, and yes it is an excuse for illicit consecrations when Lefebvre had genuine concerns that people's faith were in danger, which according to canon law you cannot be excommunicated for. I agree it is never necessary to break communion with the church, I think we're we disagree is that I don't think he did. He made it very clear he is not creating a schism, the sspx still make it clear to this day which is why they don't give bishops jurisdiction. What he did was disobedient but not schismatic.I agree it created some sort of tension between the society and rome which is unfortunate but consecration of bishops is not a schismatic act, it just simply isn't."
18voone,Bishop Williamson,l9llwqw,None,1,"Actually‚Ä¶there‚Äôs a popular argument, one used by the members of the official Apostolic Visitation, that according to the old Code of Canon Law (prior to the update put forth by JPII), the consecrations had been done in communion with Rome. Many bishops into the 1900s were consecrated without prior papal mandate, because of the difficulty of communication between Rome and certain overseas countries, the USA being one. In those days in order for a consecration to be in communion with Rome, the pontiff‚Äôs name would simply need to be mentioned in the Canon of the Mass. The consecration would eventually be recognized by papal authority sometime after the actual ceremony. Also hence the absurd amount of auxiliary bishops in the US and elsewhere.Yes, Rome was ‚Äúworking‚Äù with ML‚Ä¶but to hear both sides of the account, it seems very understandable that ML and the rest of the SSPX were skeptical. This process of waiting took nearly a decade and Rome refused to move on the subject. ML knew his death was coming, so made the decision to move forward with the consecration, which legitimately saved the work of the SSPX and by extension saved the traditional liturgy all around the world. Even the FSSP owes its existence to this act.If you want validation that Rome wasn‚Äôt going to move, find me a member of the FSSP who has been consecrated a bishop to provide for the needs of that community, even after years of requests, Rome has refused to allow such a consecration.It‚Äôs worthy of note, that just like in centuries past, after the initial excommunication was lifted, all four bishops were recognized by Rome. Williamson is a different issue who has since gone rogue from the SSPX."

Every priest is going to have sermons that miss from time to time, and especially if you can't recall anything that's seared in your mind as being awful, you can simply choose not to heed the sermon.

There‚Äôs a reason why the SSPX third order members are not allowed to attend the new mass per their rule but it would also be wrong to say that every single new mass said could be harmful even if they are all sad in comparison.

18ul77s,Women working outside the home?,kfl3exc,MarcellusFaber,5,"Married women should not ordinarily work outside of the home, for it is the man's responsibility to provide the basic necessities of life (food, clothing, shelter, etc.); to be the provider. The wife's responsibility/prerogative is in the domestic sphere. She looks after the children, cooks, cleans, does various other household chores, and makes the house a pleasant place to be. She acts as the heart of the home. Practically speaking, it is also not possible for a woman to have a full-time job outside of the home since, in a Catholic family in which everything is functioning as it should, the wife will often be pregnant and will be having to care for small children. It is not at all acceptable for other people to be regularly paid to look after the children so that the wife can go to work. Sending children to nurseries from a young age distresses the child and is also against the motherly instinct, and that for good reason.Pius XI teaches in *Quadragesimo Anno* that it is immoral for women and children to be required to work. See paragraph 71:>71. In the first place, the worker must be paid a wage sufficient to support him and his family.\[46\] That the rest of the family should also contribute to the common support, according to the capacity of each, is certainly right, as can be observed especially in the families of farmers, but also in the families of many craftsmen and small shopkeepers. But to abuse the years of childhood and the limited strength of women is grossly wrong. Mothers, concentrating on household duties, should work primarily in the home or in its immediate vicinity. It is an intolerable abuse, and to be abolished at all cost, for mothers on account of the father's low wage to be forced to engage in gainful occupations outside the home to the neglect of their proper cares and duties, especially the training of children. Every effort must therefore be made that fathers of families receive a wage large enough to meet ordinary family needs adequately. But if this cannot always be done under existing circumstances, social justice demands that changes be introduced as soon as possible whereby such a wage will be assured to every adult workingman. It will not be out of place here to render merited praise to all, who with a wise and useful purpose, have tried and tested various ways of adjusting the pay for work to family burdens in such a way that, as these increase, the former may be raised and indeed, if the contingency arises, there may be enough to meet extraordinary needs.This is not to say that there are not exceptions to this, for example, if the husband has died or is not fulfilling his responsibilities. However, this is not at all the ideal and there is a reason that charity to widows and orphans is regarded as of particular importance. It also does not mean that it is wrong for a wife to make a little money on the side, for example, with a small sewing business, and this sort of practice is praised in the wisdom literature of the Bible.As to a single woman, there is nothing wrong with her working outside of the home so long as it is in accordance with her femininity. However, I do believe that it should be viewed as a temporary arrangement until she is either married or has entered the religious life, and I also believe that part-time work should be preferred following the same kind of thinking. A woman looking for a 'career' is misguided, for the point of a job is to either support only oneself (hopefully a temporary condition) or one's family. Since it is the man's responsibility to provide for the basic necessities of life, it naturally falls to him  to have jobs/'careers'. However, I will add that 'careers' seem to be viewed nowadays through the lens of self-aggrandisement rather than that of raising a family, and as such I dislike the word."

The reason that it is better for families to put the family first is because the wife is the handmaid of the husband and together they raise their own children but the lady of the house is the one to educate the children in the house while the gentleman is tending the family farm or family business.If the adults work for other families, they become obliged to another family before their own family during that time.Traditionally, a Catholic husband has lots of money coming in from his farm and his businesses. This means that they don't need the parents to go to work for someone else.It's all in the holy Name of God and it's how God puts leading families together.This is the ideal.Today, 2024, the Socialist politics everywhere encourages each person to go out of the house every day to work for the gov or for another family.

Catholicism did away with the treatment of wives as property, as was common in the ancient pagan world. Pope Leo XIII strongly condemned the pagan treatment of women in *Arcanum Divinis,* paragraph 7:>When the licentiousness of a husband thus showed itself, nothing could be more piteous than the wife, sunk so low as to be all but reckoned as a means for the gratification of passion, or for the production of offspring. Without any feeling of shame, marriageable girls were bought and sold, like so much merchandise,(5) and power was sometimes given to the father and to the husband to inflict capital punishment on the wife. Of necessity, the offspring of such marriages as these were either reckoned among the stock in trade of the common-wealth or held to be the property of the father of the family;(6) and the law permitted him to make and unmake the marriages of his children at his mere will, and even to exercise against them the monstrous power of life and death.[https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf\_l-xiii\_enc\_10021880\_arcanum.html](https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_10021880_arcanum.html)As did Pius XI in *Casti Connubii,* paragraph 75:>75. This, however, is not the true emancipation of woman, nor that rational and exalted liberty which belongs to the noble office of a Christian woman and wife; it is rather the debasing of the womanly character and the dignity of motherhood, and indeed of the whole family, as a result of which the husband suffers the loss of his wife, the children of their mother, and the home and the whole family of an ever watchful guardian. More than this, this false liberty and unnatural equality with the husband is to the detriment of the woman herself, **for if the woman descends from her truly regal throne to which she has been raised within the walls of the home by means of the Gospel, she will soon be reduced to the old state of slavery (if not in appearance, certainly in reality) and become as amongst the pagans the mere instrument of man.**[https://www.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf\_p-xi\_enc\_19301231\_casti-connubii.html](https://www.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19301231_casti-connubii.html) But, of course, I doubt you're interested in this.

Women aren‚Äôt property, they‚Äôre just employees who aren‚Äôt paid, but are given comfortable lifestyles in exchange for their deference.No, they're not employees either; I mentioned employees to demonstrate that your use of the word 'subjugation' is not fitting. Marriage is a contract/partnership by which a man and a woman agree to share their life and raise children together; it is an unequal friendship. It is a friendship because the two parties have the common goal of getting to heaven, raising children, and living happily together. It is unequal because someone must have the final say in the family; it is not possible to have a majority in a democracy of two, and God has ordained through the natural law that it is the man who will be the head of the family. This was recognised by every human society until ours.There is a sense in which men and women are equal, in that God created them for the same purpose of loving him and in that they have similar rights that come along with their common obligations. They are not equal in physical strength, inclinations, abilities (a man cannot give birth, obviously), or in the majority of their responsibilities which are determined by their differing strengths and weaknesses, nor are they equal in authority when speaking in terms of a particular married couple.Your comparison with slavery falls apart at the first hurdle as slaves are property which can be bought and sold, yet we have already determined that wives are not property."

18ul77s,Women working outside the home?,kfzl8mx,MarcellusFaber,1,">So it‚Äôs slavery minus the slave trade, then.No. This is again, infuriatingly, an argument that attempts to appeal to emotion rather than reason. As I said earlier, slavery is the ownership of a person. Wives cannot be bought or sold, husbands are commanded to love their wives ""as Christ loved the Church"" (in case you didn't know, he was crucified for the Church), and the right of a husband to command his wife is not absolute as in chattel slavery. There are so many ways in which the noble institution of marriage differs from slavery that it is absurd that you even suggested this.>Hey, here‚Äôs a novel idea. How about marriages as an actual partnership based around compromise and genuine equality?That is not what God has ordained, not in the absolute sense that you propose (of course there is compromise in marriage, but not in everything), nor does it work in practice most of the time. Many men nowadays allow themselves to become subject to their wives in their marriages; lacking a common rule concerning who makes the final decisions, it comes down to force of personality. Not to mention that the inequality is built into our nature.>Your arguments are no different than those made by antebellum slavers, who also claimed that God created a natural order where black people were subservient to whites.I simply answer that it is not part of the natural law that Africans be subject to Europeans as it is that, in a marriage, a wife owes obedience to her husband. This owed obedience was recognised in every human society that I know of throughout history, which is obviously not the case with regard to Africans and Europeans. I can also simply reply that, if you are correct concerning the arguments of these slavers, they were mistaken concerning the state of the natural order. It is not taught by the Catholic Church, preserved from error by God and marked by him as the true religion with miracles and prophecies, that obedience is indiscriminately owed by Africans to Europeans. However, it is taught by the Catholic Church that wives must obey their husbands.>It‚Äôs awfully convenient how much God wanted white men to stay in positions of power and authority, isn‚Äôt it?Now this is just a stupid thing to say, and another attempt to turn the argument back to emotional and rhetorical devices. An African man with a European wife, or a Chinaman with a Mayan wife, or a Mongol with a Mauritian wife, would have just as much authority over his wife as a European man over his European wife would.

Every conversation devolves into ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm right because God says so‚Äù. No circular logic, not here!Perhaps it would be circular if I had no evidence for the truth of the Catholic religion (honestly I don't really see how it is; how would I be proving God's existence or the infallibility of the Church's teaching by stating that wives must obey their husbands?) . But I do, as I said, in the physical and moral miracles and in the prophecies (which are simply miracles on the intellectual plane). If you really want to get anywhere with people like me, attempt to disprove the starting point, which is the miracles and prophecies. We have claimed vastly more of these throughout history than any other religion and they are well documented. For example, the miracle of the Christians who had their tongues cut out in what is now Northern Algeria in 484 yet continued to be able to speak is attested to by the Emperor Justinian I himself, Aeneas of Gaza, Marcellinus, Count of Illyria, and Procopius of Caesarea. That is simple one example among thousands.>However you sleep at night, man.

You would be hard pressed to find any entirely peaceful societies, and any fringe examples that you do find are exceptions to the general rule.

A five-year-old could work it out. Don't be ridiculous. There are at least five sources corroborating each other, which I listed.>It doesn‚Äôt even prove THAT! Saying that ‚Äúmost societies did something‚Äù is proof of nothing in terms of morality. Most societies created money. That doesn‚Äôt make money ‚Äúthe natural order‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt make money moral or immoral. Why are you willing to extrapolate further on the placement of women in society historically and claim that it is somehow relevant today, yet you balk at applying the same logic to the existence of warfare and currency?The argument is simply that, if all human societies throughout history regard something as moral, then it is not possible, or at least exceedingly improbable, for them to have all been wrong. We all have a sense of what is right and wrong and everyone is agreed on the fundamentals (every human society recognises that murder is evil, for example), and therefore it is very unlikely for everyone to be wrong about a moral question in the same way.>On the contrary, women were subjugated by most societies BECAUSE of money and warfare. If women are still meant to be subjugated, then men should still be running at each other with spears, full stop. Technology has rendered both of these outdated customs irrelevant. And we're back to talking about 'subjugation'...I thought we'd got past this... This argument has an huge *non sequitur* in it. What has warfare got to do with treating women as property, or indeed, modern technology?

How likely is it for a group of men numbering in the tens to all develop the ability to speak without a tongue at the same time? One source even states that two of these men lost their ability to speak after a particular action? How likely is that? There is no natural explanation for any of this and to say so is absurd and based on scepticism; it's an *a priori* argument. This is also not the only example I have. We have the examples of St Bernard of Clairvaux's miracles, St Francis Xavier's, Lourdes (a prominent case being that of Peter de Rudder, whose leg in 1875 was miraculous healed after having being broken for eight years and was examined by physicians), Eucharistic miracles, and very many others.

18ul77s,Women working outside the home?,kg1i8w1,MarcellusFaber,1,">Child marriage was believed to be a moral practice by almost every society all throughout historyI disagree. I think the problem lies in your definition of what a child is.>Claiming that something is morally just because the majority finds it to be that way is a textbook ad populum fallacy, however.Let me give an example: presumably you believe that torturing puppies is wrong. I also think that you couldn't give a logical argument for this, yet you still have a sense that it is wrong. Every person has this sense.When there are difficult moral questions, there tends to be a lot of disagreement and differing opinions. However, with more fundamental questions (such as whether murder is wrong, for example), there is a consensus. If there is a consensus throughout most of history and most societies, to the point that they hold exactly the same position, then it must be concluded that mankind has reached the truth. This is because there are very many ways of being wrong, but only one way of being correct. It seems incredibly unlikely that everyone would independently come to a consensus which were wrong, for probability is against every society following the same error, there being so many errors.So, you see, it is not an appeal to the people, but rather an appeal to the fact that it would be very unlikely for everyone to be wrong in the same way independently."

18ejgax,Looking for a Persuasive Book,kcp1ics,SnowWhiteFeather,5,"https://youtu.be/XcG733oDZ58?si=70hvsuTpVodfBdsgEdit: the channel has a lot of good resources.To explain it most simply we aren't only bound by the authority of the current Pope. We are bound by the authority and teaching of all Popes. The difference obviously being that the current Pope has a duty and obligation to clarify and teach here and now.We also have a duty and obligation to reject heresy and sin. The Pope like all men has free will and he can err and sin like any of us. Papal infallibility refers to the infallibility of the Pope when he is speaking as the Pope.  A Papal decree is different than simply addressing the general public or publishing a document for that reason.The recent confusion and error largely arises from misunderstanding what level of authority given documents and teachings hold. Teachings that are not binding, but also ambigious have been used to introduce confusion into what is being practiced and taught.Vatican II was pastoral it was not dogmatic. It is not infallible or binding. The Council of Trent by contrast was an ecumenical council and so any teachings on faith or morals are binding. The following is from the Council of Trent:CANON XIII.-If any one saith, that the received and approved rites of the Catholic Church, wont to be used in the solemn administration of the sacraments, may be contemned, or without sin be omitted at pleasure by the ministers, or be changed, by every pastor of the churches, into other new ones; let him be anathema.This teaching tells us that it is anethema to compel ministers from practicing approved rites. Archbishop Lefebvre was improperly excommunicated for continuing to practice the Tridentine Rite, which was protected by the Council of Trent as I just quoted.Second edit: I am a recent convert so anyone who sees a mistake with what I said please correct me."

If you are obeying man but offending God in the process, this is not true obedience. I do think that in this current crisis in the Church the laity will be given a wide berth in terms of culpability, as we have all been severely let down by the clerics in the Church (and conversely their judgement will be all the more harsh). I agree with you that disobeying a man while making the claim that it is to avoid displeasing God is a slippery slope (and I venture to guess that the SSPX would agree with you as well), which is why it's important to examine the fruits of such claims. The SSPX is not without its failures over its relatively short life, however its members have done a remarkable job in staying on the path Archbishop Lefebvre set them on. The SSPX's disobedience **could** be the thin edge of a protestant wedge, but so far they have done nothing in the past 53 years to indicate that it is so (why haven't they engaged in more extreme behavior?). Personally, I do wish they did a better job at emphasizing how they are deviating from (contemporary) Rome, and just being more transparent in general, but compared to the rest of the Church they are doing quite well."

The Church is where we belong and everyone should feel welcome.I would like to try to clarify what we are talking about though.Divorce does not exist in the Catholic Church.There is seperation, which can be justified in the case of abuse. Sometimes during seperation a civil divorce is necessary (I believe it is necessary to seek approval first), but a civil divorce is only a divorce on paper. The marriage still remains intact.There is annulment, which is the recognition that the marriage wasn't completed properly and for that reason it is invalid. (Annulments are given out in some diocese like secular ""divorces"" and this is an abuse of authority. There is a high standard that should be met to prove that the marriage didn't happen.)In terms of dealing with judgement though that is another matter. It is going to be difficult, but as Catholics we try not to shy away from that which is hard. I would ask God for grace and try to forgive those who have wounded you.

177h1jk,Solemn high mass,k4xdrxj,Piklikl,3,"The SSPX simply doesn't have enough priests. Solemn High Mass is celebrated with a Deacon and Subdeacon. Since the SSPX doesn't typically circulate the actual ordained Deacons and Subdeacons around the mass centers/""parishes"" (they typically stay at the Seminary when not on vacation or some sort of sabbatical), those positions at a SHM must be filled by priests. So for a Sunday Mass to be Solemn High you would need to tie up 3 priests for the entire Mass (and don't forget those priests also wouldn't be able to assist with distributing Communion, so you'd have to get more priests to assist with distribution).People seem to think that St. Marys has 11 priests lounging about while the 12th says Mass on Sunday, but most of them are gone on the weekends supporting mission chapels. The ones that aren't aren't have more than their fair share of work to do as they're likely teachers at the Academy and professors at the College, not to mention they are Spiritual Directors and also must tend to their diriges. Don't forget there's lots of Confessions to be heard! If there's 4,000 faithful in SM, that's 1 priest for every 333 faithful.

16vuj3z,Catholic man in need of a wife! SSPX= Solution?,ltlsx6u,None,2,"Before I learned that this was satire, I actually agreed with a lot of it, lol. I‚Äôm a Sspx trad wife and I do all of those things for my husband. I seriously enjoy it. Married him at 21 and now I‚Äôm 22 with our first son. Saved my virginity for marriage. I never learned how to cook (because I was poor) until I married him and he did not mind at all. He loves what I cook and if I fail, he loves the effort anyway. He‚Äôs a real man and takes care of me and is very sweet. His duties are equal if not more than my own. I love living out God's perfect design. These things listed should probably not be said to a potential wife unless you want to scare her off (LOL), but, if she chose you and is willing to live out biblical womanhood, these duties are implied. You also have to be a very Christlike husband to motivate her to do her duties. I serve him even when he doesn‚Äôt deserve it and vice versa. Love is a choice. I chose him. He is my best friend and I'd never treat him badly. And because I try to keep a forgiving and supportive spirit (instead of belittling him), he has beaten his corn addiction that he's had since 13. I've never been happier for him. Men will change for God with a determined helpmate/helpmeet and a lot of prayer. This is the list in which I recommend any traditional Catholic woman to look for in a man that is ready for marriage.1. Loves God with all his heart, defends His honor, prays, and lives by His commandments.2. Is 100% pro-life.3. Does not have a porn, nicotine, or alcohol addiction (you need to ask BEFORE deciding to court him).4. Honors his mother and father.5. Respectful, patient, humble, and assertive when needed.6. Hardworking, sacrificial, and is willing to provide for a family.7. Receives the sacraments.8. Chaste and protects your virginity until marriage.9. Confident in his masculinity.10. Desires fatherhood.These are only some of the points that are important to look for early on; otherwise, you will be in for a difficult time trying to navigate healing during your marriage. Catholicism is not for the weak, which is why this world encourages a self-serving lifestyle. Those deceived by it may never see the face of Jesus. A good, Catholic marriage invites graces that will help you and your spouse make it to heaven together, with little distraction from the outside world. Choose wisely who you will love."

16rw8xi,My wife‚Äôs heart isn‚Äôt in the mass,k25m5k0,NtGiL_29,8,"I really feel for you - definitely not an enviable situation to be in. One of the main attributes of the Latin Mass is that it is mystical. It sounds like you have done more than a reasonable amount to try and inform your wife about the merits of the Mass. I think that at this point the most effective route to go would just be to petition God to grow her devotion to the Mass. God does things every day that are so far beyond human power that it is unbelievable.One material question - can you consistently hear the priest during the Mass? I have found that it is a much better experience for those who are not diehard Latin Mass attenders if they can hear the priest saying the different parts of the Mass such as the confiteor, pax Domini, and preface."
16rw8xi,My wife‚Äôs heart isn‚Äôt in the mass,k26v0vx,Piklikl,9,"We don't necessarily need to fully understand what's happening at Mass (and ultimately we never will be able to), and we also don't need to get anything out of attending Mass. We don't primarily attend Mass because of what we get out of it, but mostly because God has demanded that we do so. It is enough for her to tell God that she simply doesn't understand what's going on, but she is remaining faithful to His wishes by attending the sacrifice at which Catholics are all bound to attend on all Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation. Her heart doesn't necessarily need to be in the Mass (by which I mean she doesn't need to feel like her heart is in the Mass), for her to fulfill her obligations. Of course, it helps a whole lot if we do attempt to gain a greater understanding of the Mass and at least have an idea of what's going on (eg the significance of the primary parts of the Mass: Offertory, Sacrifice, Communion, the origin of the various prayers, the significance of the Vestments and Sacred Linens, etc). It's important that you be aware that it can be very easy for someone to get overwhelmed by the density of information present in the Mass, and that translates to discouragement and detachment. **It's extremely important that you meet her where she is at**, and help her take tiny steps towards learning more about the Mass. This starts first and foremost with a good missal (the [AP Daily Missal](https://angeluspress.org/products/genuine-leather-1962-roman-catholic-daily-missal) is a universal favorite), but also don't just buy her a missal and chuck it at her and expect all your problems to be resolved. Sadly there isn't a good resource that I'm aware of that teaches people how to use a missal properly, but if you know how to use one then you should do your best to teach her. If you don't have a missal and can't afford one, then a decent compromise might be to load [this website](https://www.divinumofficium.com/cgi-bin/missa/missa.pl)on your phone and discreetly read from your phone during Mass. Heck with a baby it might even be a lot easier to read from the phone during mass than trying to wrangle and infant and a missal at the same time.The important thing to realize is that your wife missed out on a lot of crucial formation as a child (not her fault), so for a time her learning path will closely resemble that of a child, and there is no shame in that. This is also a very good opportunity for the both of you to actively engage in preparing for the education you both will give your son about the Faith. Many times we only really learn about important things because we think it's important for our kids to learn about those things."
16rw8xi,My wife‚Äôs heart isn‚Äôt in the mass,k28pk8x,ChristRespector,4,"I went through something similar so I feel your struggle. There‚Äôs no silver bullet but doing the daily readings together and praying together definitely helped me. If she is a faithful Catholic and regularly attends mass with you, you are very lucky and shouldn‚Äôt worry too much about her sharing your passion for the traditional mass.My wife has never read a book, watched video or listened to a podcast I‚Äôve recommended to her. But she always has an open ear to listen to me talk. And as long as I dont sound like I‚Äôm taking down to her or trying to sway her, she has an open mind. So try to put things in your own words, be patient with her, and have faith. You dont need to worry about the little one as long as you are doing your job as a dad to properly catechize and love your children. You got this."

I‚Äôve only heard a handful of sermons in their entirety since becoming a mother myself. God knows our vocation though. One thing my spiritual director has suggested is that I contemplate the four means of prayer prior to mass so I can refer back to those four things every mass. Each mass I have different intentions and prayers and they help to keep me refocused between the feedings and corrections of the children. Perhaps try suggesting something like this? Take the pressure off her to be fully 100% in the mass, due to her station in life that isn‚Äôt realistic. But four simple yet honest prayers offered to Our Lord is realistic, and can grow a devotion to the mass. Also, The Weight of a Mass is a great children‚Äôs picture book you should look into for your little one and it might even help your wife. I will keep your family in prayer."

164wtxj,We‚Äôre the 1950s an ideal time?,jyayitb,Piklikl,7,"Clearly it wasn't, because the 1950's led to the sexual revolution of the 1960's. Most of the stereotypes of the ""average"" person during the 1950's wasn't actually average, just a small, wealthy demographic. It's like air travel during the 50's and 60's: everyone loves to talk about how luxurious air travel was back in the ""good old days"", but fail to do the math and realize that a round trip, cross country ticket would cost [the equivalent of $4,000](https://brilliantio.com/how-much-were-plane-tickets-in-the-1960s/). Even if most households looked like the one you described, it's far from ideal and extremely chauvinistic (which is not at all Catholic). Also heels and makeup are bad for one's health, so I find it disturbing when men expect women to undergo these things in order to please them. Add to that the disgusting attitude of "" seldom spoke when their husband didn‚Äôt care to hear from them"" and it's no surprise that once divorce was broadly legalized in 1969 the flood of female initiated divorces. ""Sufficient to the day is there evil thereof"". There is no time in history that is objectively better than any other (from a Catholic perspective), because God makes available top each and every person the graces necessary for salvation."

The sung Low Mass will have songs at the beginning of mass, the Offertory, the Communion and the end of mass, but the rubrics and number of Altar Boys are the same as a Low Mass. The High Mass (sometimes referred to as a Missa Cantata) has a priest who chants in Latin throughout mass. It also has an MC (or Master of Ceremonies), a Thurifer, a Crucifer and Acolytes bearing candles (a Torch Bearer)It's been my experience that most parishes don't have sung low masses.

I used to think it was fine to go to the beach anywhere anytime, but it's like, you know there will be the nudity. And you can't really be like, well everyone else does it, or I can't be expected to give up going to the beach. Because yeah, we can definitely give it up for Christ.

15s2kdo,Beaches and pools,jy2c2s5,apisDei,2,"The Church has condemned mixed beaches. Beaches used to be separated between men and women. For me, as a man, a beach/pool is definitely an occasion of sin. Sadly the same is true for gyms.

In the around 50 times that I went, never once did I intentionally commit a sin of thought or look, or even feel a passion stirred up.

15s2kd1,Beaches and pools,jwcnfmp,Piklikl,2,"Swimming continues to be a contentious topic among traditional Catholics. Generally speaking, I think most priests would advise against any sort of mixed swimming. I think it‚Äôs contentious because the world tells us mixed swimming is perfectly fine and normal, and anyone who thinks otherwise is just a weirdo; so lots of Catholics end up going along with it because it‚Äôs considered normal. Given what is considered normal for a woman these days to wear while swimming, one can easily make the argument that it‚Äôs an occasion of sin, especially for young men/boys who have not learned custody of the eyes. To answer your third question, I‚Äôve never heard of any SSPX related organizations holding any sort of event that involved mixed swimming. In Saint Marys, KS, parishioners would regularly rent out the public pool and have boys only or girls only swim. The public pool actually ended up closing down simply because so few people used it (likely because of the principled stance against mixed swimming among the majority of people in the town). I would be interested to hear discussion about mixed swimming when it comes to families, whether immediate or extended. My inclination is that it‚Äôs not a good idea but perhaps I‚Äôm too strict."

I see more immodesty in the stores, on my commute, etc..  than I ever see at the beach or pool.  No way to avoid it except through self sufficient communal living. My 2 cents.  And teenagers will struggle with or without seeing immodest behavior. It‚Äôs a part of puberty.  We grow up and leave the things of childhood behind."

It depends entirely on the institution and who runs it. .In St Mary's Kansas for instance the students get a strong grounding in the Latin language although the majority are certainly not fluent in it. In seminary, quite a bit more Latin is expected and after 5 years an SSPX Priest can certainly converse adequately in Latin in addition to the prayers he learns for saying the Mass and the other institutions are just a hodgepodge of different Latin fluencies depending on who the Rector is."
15r4jij,Latin Instruction in SSPX Seminaries and Schools,jw75srd,johnny63339,6,"As far as the seminaries go, the only one I have any personal experience with is when the society had its main seminary in Winona Minnesota and Bishop Williamson was the Rector. There although he would occasionally speak short sentences in Latin to the seminarians, the majority of give and take was in English. Richard Williamson by the way is quite fluent in Latin and is somewhat of a word nerd.. lol.. please pray for him as I fear his time on this Earth is not a great deal longer. Perhaps someone can comment concerning the Econe,, South America France, Germany and the other seminaries around the world"

15qgnld,SSPX newbie question- sorry if this is stupid,jw31cq4,afogleson,11,"I'm not sure why this is always the assumption, that the sspx is not in communion with Rome. Everytime Rome has called them the sspx has responded. Francis recognized the sspx ability to hear confessions and perform weddings (and thus say mass) that all sounds like in communion with Rome."
15qgnld,SSPX newbie question- sorry if this is stupid,jw39kv5,Piklikl,6,"Probably the easiest way to think about the SSPX is they‚Äôre Roman Catholic priests who are waiting for a better explanation of the changes to the Roman Rite after 1962. Anytime explanations are asked for, the Vatican refuses to elaborate, which is suspicious. Switching Rites is a big deal for the faithful, and even bigger for priests. You can‚Äôt just go to a Marian Rite one Sunday and then go to an Eastern Rite the next. Orthodox are schismatic, so it‚Äôs wrong to attend their liturgy just because they have a good track recording of consistency (because they‚Äôre consistently wrong). The Othodox Church cannot be the same Church Christ founded since they deny the primacy of Peter and thus forfeit their Apostolicity, which is one of the 4 marks of the True Church.  The TLM, whether offered by FSSP, Diocesan, or any other priest is only possible thanks to the SSPX and its founder, Archbishop Lefebvre. The naysayers of the SSPX love to pretend as though  the TLM would still be around if the Archbishop had not resisted the changes, but if you know the history and sequence of events of the past 60 years you know that the TLM is still around thanks to the SSPX. Those who think that one can endorse all the changes since V2 and expect the Church to thrive in the long run as long as they still have a TLM to attend are at best just ‚Äúsmells and bells Catholics‚Äù, and their Faith is quite superficial."
15qgnld,SSPX newbie question- sorry if this is stupid,jw53nsi,None,2,">it's super traditional catholics who aren't in communion with rome?By the Vatican's own words that the SSPX aren't in ""regular"" communion with Rome, but both sides are working to achieve that. Which essentially means that they have an ""irregular canonical status"". However, let's be 100% clear here, they are certainly not outside the church. They are fully considered fully Roman Catholic with valid holy orders and you can fulfill  your Sunday obligation there unless your bishop gives you explicit instructions to the contrary. You can also receive valid confession and holy matrimony with the SSPX.&#x200B;>have SSPX people considered being orthodox then?No. This is not typical of SSPX attendees. Orthodoxy lacks a few Catholic dogma which came about after the great schism in 1054. SSPX is fully Catholic and accepts all the same dogma of the faith that Pope Francis and the current magisterium believes in. The defining characteristic of the SSPX is the belief that the Church is in a crisis that arose after Vatican II and the Novus Ordo Mass. To make the leap to Orthodoxy, the typical process would likely be getting convinced that the roots of the crisis come from Vatican I and not Vatican II, at that point it could be possible they would explore Orthodoxy. This subject is very dense so i'll leave it there.&#x200B;>why not just go to a TLM or eastern catholic church?Well, TLM diocesan churches are being suppressed and outright banned. If anyone can find a diocesan TLM they are welcome to go. However, I think it's worth noting that Diocesan TLM likely wouldn't even have ever existed without Archbishop Lefebvre and the SSPX preserving it. For example, my diocesan TLM Pastor was trained by the SSPX to say the TLM and this is very common.Eastern Catholic church is a completely different tradition. The typical SSPX attendee probably has respect for the Eastern Divine Liturgy and traditions and may even attend a divine liturgy from time to time. However, the SSPX and it's attendees seek to preserve the traditional Latin-Rite. The primary purpose of the SSPX is to save souls, and the secondary purpose is to preserve the liturgy, tradition, customs, as the church goes through the current crisis.&#x200B;Let me know if you have questions."

The SSPX is spread out all across the world with missions. Resources are scarce. Its a global body.

So, while all TLMs are beautiful in their own right, just be aware that if you really want to experience an extraordinarily ornate TLM liturgy, it may be outside the SSPX.Book recommendations on SSPX:1.

15qgnld,SSPX newbie question- sorry if this is stupid,jw42jwy,Piklikl,2,Ask all the questions you would like. The method of receiving a convert differs from location to location (though I hear the SSPX is standardizing as best it can to something similar to RCIA). You‚Äôll want to get in touch with your nearest SSPX location. You‚Äôll likely be questioned about your baptism to determine validity and if there is any doubt you‚Äôll likely get a conditional baptism after about a year of classes.
15nmcuq,Does SSPX make a difference?,jvnieal,Piklikl,5,"This is purely anecdotal, but from what I've seen, it's much more likely for someone to progress in holiness with the SSPX. The NO tries too hard to compromise with the world, which is a futile endeavor. If you read Open Letter To Confused Catholics, a tidy book by the founder of the SSPX, I think you will understand better how the men in the hierarchy of the Church in the 60's and 70's robbed us and billions of souls of a great theological and liturgical tradition. The Church is supposed to stand in stark contrast to the world, the members of the SSPX (side note, only priests are members of the SSPX) have no problem doing that yet most NO priests seem to almost be apologetic to the world for the Faith."

But I still struggle with the idea of doing a dry mass instead of a novus ordo if I am traveling. I wish the NO didnt exist and we just had TLM. But it just feels wrong to not go to any mass.

15g9ug8,"No TLM near me, what to do",juvi6ui,Sleepy_Man90,1,"We've been told by our priest that the NO mass isn't a proper mass, they don't do it correctly so it's functionally the same as not attending mass in terms of enriching your soul.

Full partition connected to the wall (so you couldn't do face-to-face even if you wanted to), a kneeler, traditional act of contrition hung on the wall, the whole nine yards. The priest hearing confessions at that time was new to that church and surprisingly wasn't that bad.

15aydur,What to do if I don‚Äôt have any SSPX Diocese in my area?,jtndk4e,Piklikl,7,"To clarify, a diocese is a geographic region over which a bishop has jurisdiction. The SSPX is a missionary society, so the SSPX Bishops have no jurisdiction. The SSPX has chapels all over the world, in places you wouldn't expect. It's always a good idea to send an email to whichever [SSPX District](https://fsspx.org/en/content/5925) you're in (there's a few countries that the SSPX has missions in but for political reasons they have to maintain secrecy) to see if you truly have no options; they will also be able to provide you with contact information of any independent traditional priests who live in the area. Also there's places (such as Dubai) where the SSPX visits every few months but they don't typically advertise it because it's so infrequent.The SSPX advises the laypeople to steer clear of the Novus Ordo Mass, but when it comes to confession while you might get some unorthodox advice, the SSPX doesn't question the validity of a ""N.O. Confession"".  If you need to go to confession, then I don't see any issue with you going to a NO Priest. Also don't be afraid to ask a NO priest about the Latin Mass (it really helps if you know how to serve). You never know who among them would like to say a Latin Mass privately so it's always something worth mentioning. A friend of mine asked the military chaplain in basic training about the Latin Mass options and the priest ended up saying a private Latin Mass once a week that he could serve at. You might consider having a ""Sunday Routine"" where you spend an hour or so in prayer as well as making a special effort to sanctify the day. We are blessed to have at our disposal quite a range of Masses live streamed from SSPX Chapels on YouTube, so you could even tune in and attend Mass virtually. Also something to consider is if you're able to take trips every few months to places that do have the sacraments."

It's by no means a blanket statement.Taken from Fr. Lovasik in the book **Clean Love in Courtship**, the best way to approach a young Catholic woman is to develop a platonic friendship with her first (and several others as well), and then after a while, when you have determined that the personalities/interests/worldviews match, then you ask for courtship.

I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer shall be turned into my bosom. \[Psalm 34:13\]When St Augustine gave the sermon on the verse, he admitted he can't find the proof in NT, or during the time of persecution, our lord himself was not put on haircloth or fasting. But still  it was the teaching in this psalm. He did not mention repent or confession in haircloth too. I am not sure the catholic practice at fouth centure.But I think haircloth is a way of repent, feel sorry for wrong doing and repent. And a contrit of heart is an acceptable sacrifice.  Fasting is refrain from food, or any form of sense pleasure. You can't miss either of the two, in order to achieve the 3rd,  into my bosom my prayer shall be turned. By put on haircloth, you let the mortal sins die, and released your own stress, or in another verse ""burn my reins and my heart"" \[Psalm 25.2\].  To sum up, by means of confession and fasting you will have a better prayer life."

Maybe SSPX will put someone up to the job some day."

We attend Mass almost every week, we go to confession and receive communication (on the tongue not the hand!), we are on first name basis with most of the congregation at this point and have made friends for life.I find that people will argue against me more if religion comes into question, moreover because we're traditionalist and people think that we're behind the times and want women to suffer and kids to suffer etc, but that's really not the case. I try to explain but you'll know yourself, people are set in their ways and just want an argument.But overall we feel so at home in the SSPX and we have absolutely no regrets, it's changed our faith and made it so strong."

12j443o,CMRI wedding,jfxu0ks,MarcellusFaber,-2,"None of the traditional bishops have apostolic succession, not even the SSPX ones. Ordinary jurisdiction is required to be a successor of the Apostles. There is controversy surrounding the beginnings of the CMRI (they were exceedingly messy) and the validity of their orders due to the peculiar behaviour of Archbishop Thuc. Mario Derksen wrote a study of the Thuc consecrations which argues strongly that we are not permitted to doubt their validity of the Thuc consecrations by the laws of the Church, though that does not mean that they were all licit.The Society relied for a very long time on supplied jurisdiction for the validity of its marriages (I do not know exactly if they do still; the situation has become more complex). I don't see how they could possibly argue that CMRI weddings are invalid without admitting that their own were for thirty years.I would be quite happy to go as I would convinced of the validity of the marriage reading canon 1098 of the old code, which does not require a priest with delegated jurisdiction (the parish priest) if the ordinary or his delegate is not available. This only convinces me because I am in fact a 'Sede', however. You would have to be convinced that the orders of the priest saying the Nuptial Mass were valid to participate, however."

Consequently jurisdiction in the Church can neither be obtained nor held against the will of her supreme authority; its transmission depends entirely upon legitimate succession. **It is not sufficient, therefore, that a church have valid Orders; it must also have a legitimate succession of ministers, reaching back in an unbroken line to the Apostles, upon whom our Lord conferred all authority to rule His Church.**‚Äù ‚Äì Pgs. 140-141 (my emphasis)"

Children are naturally much more sympathetic and the impact of the movie in my option will help them to love and understand Jesus sacrifice much greater than if they are older. All Catholic Churches have crucifixes in them and art of the passion so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs inappropriate to show them. After all our lady of Fatima game the three children a vision of hell itself which is arguably much more traumatizing than the movie.

Another argument I've heard is that we veil things that are sacred, and since women bring life into the world, there's a certain sense in which they could be considered sacred. I don't know how traditional this argument is, however. A brilliant series of articles was published by Tradition in Action which explains the reasons for veiling, though I must warn you that it is very long: [https://www.traditioninaction.org/religious/d005rpVeil\_1\_Goodman.htm](https://www.traditioninaction.org/religious/d005rpVeil_1_Goodman.htm)I do support women going back to veiling all the time (though not like the Muhammadans), but that usually gets me labelled a nutter!

125tmpq,Headcovering,jf5wqta,None,3,"I do not have knowledge about the historical reasons for women covering their heads during Holy Mass, but as a Catholic of tradition, I can say that I greatly appreciate this attitude and am very grateful to women for doing so. It helps me focus on the Holy Mass. Thanks to this, I do not get distracted."
125tmpq,Headcovering,je7lzlk,GoneFishin56,2,"Another reason is that femininity is sacred. In our Church, the most sacred things are veiled, such as the tabernacle, the chalice, etc"
125tmpq,Headcovering,je8h2ai,rathdrummob,1,"Wear a veil if you want to. I can‚Äôt tell from your comment if you‚Äôre looking for a reason to wear one or looking for some reason not to. You don‚Äôt need the church to tell you to, they obviously don‚Äôt. Unless it‚Äôs just a search for something to be scrupulous about, just wear it if it helps you or you just like the way it looks."
125tmpq,Headcovering,je9ye8c,Highwayman90,1,"My understanding is that it's because a woman can bring life into the world, thus she should be veiled as sacred."
125tmpq,Headcovering,je66qwm,Cato2011,5,"I also support women veiling outside of the home.  The Virgin Mary is the peak of womanhood, and I have never seen a sacred image if Her bareheaded."
125tmpq,Headcovering,je9bfjb,Mandapanda82,1,No it‚Äôs just genuinecuriosity
125tmpq,Headcovering,jec0vee,Mandapanda82,1,"My question isn‚Äôt just why we veil-my question is why is veiling ONLY expected at mass and headcovering not required all the time. If a woman is sacred, she doesn‚Äôt cease to be sacred outside of mass. If it‚Äôs general modesty, it should extend outside of mass. And sure, an individual woman could discern to headcover full time, I‚Äôm just curious for traditional Catholic reasoning for only veiling during mass."
125tmpq,Headcovering,je67ovm,Mandapanda82,2,"This is also another consideration I have been mulling over. Women ideally are called to Marian standards of dress even outside of mass, (though obviously not in the totally literal sense of ancient Jewish custom), but I don‚Äôt know why that would exclude headcovering of some sort (and like the above commenter, I don‚Äôt mean a hijab). In apparitions her head is almost always covered. In fact, I believe there was an uproar over the depiction of her apparition in Akita because it depicted her with her head uncovered."
125tmpq,Headcovering,je6a6qk,Cato2011,2,"Until about the 1960s I believe all women in the Western world wore a hat or head covering.  Men wore hats, too for that matter.  It‚Äôs probably a custom that just died out or was abandoned."
125tmpq,Headcovering,jec1wwh,Mandapanda82,1,"This is kind of what I am thinking. Vatican II didn‚Äôt address veiling, though my understanding is it was erroneously reported in American that it was abrogated. Previous to VII, most women at least wore hats when going out and it probably never occurred to the pre-VII Church that there was a need to address it because for the most part, there wasn‚Äôt at the time. But for me that still begs the question-what does God want women to do? The SSPX addresses feminine modesty and dress even outside of mass, except when it comes to headcovering. And of course, the mainstream Church thinks anything goes-even if you‚Äôre wearing a mini skirt to mass. There seems to be a gap in guidance here but I also don‚Äôt want to go making up my own rules or interpreting the Bible myself."
125tmpq,Headcovering,jec9xr3,Cato2011,1,"Well, we do have to look to what modesty means in our own culture and that of Christianity.  God didn‚Äôt provide any dress code in scripture.  How you dress sends out a message.  In my SSPX chapel, we have a dress code and for women it says dresses should be past the knee and sleeves should cover the elbows.  No form fitting clothes.  Veils in church.  I think everyone would agree that‚Äôs modest."
125tmpq,Headcovering,jjvw4et,None,1,I am in RCIA at a standard NO parish... very nice... but the amount of mini skirts drives me nuts... all I can look is at the alter... and sometimes we have lay people go up to read with their booty-tight dresses... mind you I am not an old fart... 20 years old with an awesome GF... but i don't wana be seeing these things during mass of all things...
125tmpq,Headcovering,jjvwlff,None,2,my no parish could use that... in fact my NO parish at my mom... a lady wiped out her full bare boob out like clint eastwood during mass...mind blown...

11nwmis,"[Opinions] St. Marys, KS",jbr3abz,boesno,11,"I live in St Marys and my wife grew up here. The scandals are real but it‚Äôs complicated and you have to look at each case individually. I‚Äôve seen stories reported that are true, half true and laughably wrong. People move to St Marys for many different reasons but a lot of times it‚Äôs because they are trying find a better situation for their families and think that St Marys will fix things. Sometimes a familys situation is just really hard to fix and a large family has large problems. People here say that years ago St Marys was in ‚Äúsurvival mode.‚Äù People were upset with what was happening in the church and moved to St Marys looking for help and answers from the SSPX. There were no jobs in rural Kansas and people were trying desperately to find a good situation for their families.  In the last 15 years a lot of that has changed. A lot of tough, intelligent and moral people moved here. They started good businesses and now there is money being made and people move here for jobs and not just the church. The SSPX has grown and matured as an organization. There is now good staff, policies and financing in place to make the school and church the best it can be.It‚Äôs easy to sensationalize St Marys because the whole places sounds crazy on the surface buts it‚Äôs just the larger version of your typical SSPX chapel. I think the town is dynamic and there are  great people here."
11nwmis,"[Opinions] St. Marys, KS",jcbqkvz,None,6,"I lived in Saint Marys for about 10 years and moved about 3 years ago.Overall, its a great town, with an amazing Catholic spirit and some great people. I attended the college there and that was the best two years of my life.Pros: Extremely easy access to the sacraments, a large number of liturgy offered (Divine office, vespers, etc), a very diverse population (in the true sense), surrounded by large families and clergy, and a new beautiful church that they are 95% completed with and consecrating on May 3rd.Cons: Small town (depending on if you like that or not), economically monolithic (theres really only 1-2 places to work to earn a living unless you plan on working in Topeka and Manhattan and even those are limited depending on what you do for a living), and a general lack of things to do (its a small town in rural kansas after all).The other thing ill call out as the biggest con is: an extremely large parish. Cannot tell you how many people I spoke to when I left Saint Marys of how they felt unwelcome coming in, and it felt very closed off from the rest of the world. Some of that is by design, but alot of it is frankly how many people there are there. Im not sure where current numbers stand now but its a parish of about 3-4K (including children). That being said its difficult to make friends or immerse yourself in one of the many sub communities unless you know someone, its just kinda how it works. I remember i came back to visit and sparked up a conversation with someone who I had never met, and mentioned ""Ive never met you before, did you just move here? and he said ""no ive lived here for 25 years"". Gives you an idea of how massive the place is.Now, regarding your sex scandal questions: I definitely would not say there are ""alot"". Of course, where there is smoke, there is fire, and I do believe there have been some accusations from a couple of individuals regarding this.  I have not peered into the news of these lately but I do not think anyone has been convicted yet. So are there some that are true? Maybe. But there are also many that are 100% false, and people who have a bone to pick with a certain priest or the system or what have you and just trying to bring things down to their level. Pure malice in my opinion. But like I said, im sure sadly that some are true, but I wouldnt base that on the town per se, the abuse happens everywhere sadly.Overall: I recommend the college and its professors 1000%, truly one of the gifts of the SSPX is that college. Now, Living there as a parishioner long term? for me I decided to move because I wanted to a) be at a parish that actually needs more resources versus Saint Marys where they have literally everything from a parish perspective, b) live in a more populated area for better access to jobs and fun things to do with the kids, and c) wasnt a fan of being 1 of 4000, wanted more of a medium sized parish vibe where I can actually know my parish and the people who attend it."

11nwmis,"[Opinions] St. Marys, KS",jbtfst7,KpopKia,3,"People do bad things all the time all over the place.  St. Marys isn't different just because it's the largest traditional Catholic parish in the world.  I've lived here since 1994. There are some things about it that bother me, but there are more things about it that I love.  I wish I could tell you that it is some kind of great Catholic eutopia paradise. It isn't. Sometimes, religion seems to bring out the worst in people, and I don't know why.  That is not the Church's fault.  But it is a great place to live and be a part of. Crazy people? Yes, a few.  We tend to roll our eyes and keep moving. Great people that you want to be friends with and have a community with? Absolutely.  These are the people we embrace and open our arms to. You are going to find bad people and bad situations wherever you choose to live.I love living here, and I'm so grateful to be a part of the community that is here.  I'm pretty sure this is where I'm going to stay."

11nwmis,"[Opinions] St. Marys, KS",jepfo22,Piklikl,2,"Remember, anytime there's any sort of accusation, no matter how baseless, both the SSPX and the civil authorities must do their due diligence and perform an investigation. While the SSPX does not need to publicize its internal investigations (although I think there's a case to be made that it would be in their best interests to have at least something approaching it), the civil authorities sometimes will publicize their investigations. Also those who are in the habit of making frivolous or baseless accusations are also the ones most likely to run to the media to get their private little crusade won.  It's extremely unfortunate, but there have been a few sexual scandals that actually did occur, and the reality is it's better to err on the side of ""over reporting"" them, instead of trying to cover them up. The downside of this approach is that the reputation of the SSPX ultimately has to take a hit, but it's much easier to recover from a false accusation reputation loss vs a covered up scandal that was found out reputation loss."

When you start chasing wealth, I don't care what it's for, it's avarice. Look at how bad the Vatican Bank is. Perhaps Our Lord is showing you by these failures that it is not your duty of state.

Yes a few protestants but never the less our goal is the same, To promote Christendom and donate some of the proceeds to charitable causes. For me all Charitiable causes need to be Catholic but they think in general a Christian cause is enough. The debt that is left behind is such that I would not be able to pay it off and would work endlessly to pay it all. So I thought to myself why not work at what he was doing instead of doing menial jobs or jobs which wouldn't make me happy. So I would spend the rest of my life unhappy because I never at least tried to reach my potential and make a good business.

100qge3,SSPX in Wisconsin,jepjmc8,Piklikl,2,"I can sympathize with the IRL awkwardness, while I know fellowship is not a bad thing, I usually just leave right after mass & thanksgiving instead of hang around and chat with strangers. I think you might have some luck if you find some way to reach out to the priest via email (or even text). The vast majority of the priests have a good sense of their parishes and if you explain your situation (and don't be afraid to mention your perception of the cold shoulder at your tattoos) the priest will likely be able to put you in touch with key people that will help you get involved. A shortcut to getting involved in the parish is to volunteer to help out with stuff, that's not online, but it's definitely a fast track to integration."

zogqno,NSFW,j0nptwe,HalfheartedHart,3,"**No.**I'm approaching this with the assumption that we're talking about the circumcision of an infant. A lot of people (young Catholic parents included) seem to be obliviously following the ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù practice in the USA of allowing their sons to be circumcised without even questioning it.But it seems pretty straight forward that it is not permissible for Catholics.Catholic medical ethics forbids amputation of a healthy part of the body without medical necessity. I implore you to respect his bodily integrity and refuse to have any son of yours circumcised. It is a risky and unnecessary surgery that has lasting negative effects and no medical justification.And yes, ""...While Jesus was circumcized in obedience to the Law and as a shadow of His shedding His Blood at Calvary, He did **not** undergo the procedure that is used by modern, post-Temple Jews and by doctors in Western hospitals today.""  https://www.fisheaters.com/circumcision.html [emphasis added]www.catholicsagainstcircumcision.org has lots of helpful information on the subject, especially the articles linked here: https://www.catholicsagainstcircumcision.org/articles/Other resources include www.yourwholebaby.org and www.nocirc.org"

If it is done for a religious reason, it is a mortal sin as, by following the old law, one is implicitly stating that Our Lord has not yet come and denying the truth of the Catholic religion. If circumcision is done for a justifiable medical reason, then it is allowed.EDIT. Looking at the comment by HalfheartedHart, I realise that I did not recall the practice in the United States of general circumcision. This is not the case in England. I believe HalfheartedHart explains the medical side of things well."
zn8lad,Going where they‚Äôre called,j0gaeuk,Piklikl,5,"The SSPX doesn‚Äôt really have a blueprint for opening a new chapel, but typically if there‚Äôs at least a small group of faithful wanting the TLM and sacraments, the SSPX will do it‚Äôs best to service them. As far as I know there‚Äôs no consideration of whether or not a location is in a liberal diocese or not. The SSPX also assigns it‚Äôs priests all over the world, usually for at least a few years at a time. Typically a priest can‚Äôt just leave his assignment and go to one that he wants; that would be abandoning his post."
zn8lad,Going where they‚Äôre called,j0g9zs4,None,2,"I remember a priest saying, multiple times actually, that a small group of people was asking for a chapel in a specific part of the country, yet they needed more priests in order to set a chapel there, money to build it... So yes, it does seem they arrange missions, and eventually chapels, in areas where there's enough laity interested in them."
zn8lad,Going where they‚Äôre called,j0igbht,Cato2011,1,"Right now the Society is everywhere - either there‚Äôs a church, mission, or a traveling priest who visits.

Once it reaches a certain point, the area gets ‚Äúup graded.‚Äù Meaning an occasional mass center might become a mission or there might be enough faithful to add a mass here or there.  The reverse is also true.  It an area dwindles, masses are canceled or chapels closed."

zl8921,FSSP and the SSPX,j047op2,Piklikl,11,"I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll find much online, and there never has been any sort of formal relationship between the two organizations. My understanding is that the SSPX leadership are tolerant and willing to let bygones be bygones, but likely will never be able to publicly have this position because of the harm the FSSP has done to many families (the FSSP likes to set up shop near SSPX centers, and then push lots of anti-SSPX propaganda and tell SSPX attendees they‚Äôre all going to hell). It would be seen as an insult to many families who had to put up with the hate and vitriol from the FSSP parishioners for the SSPX leadership to formally pronounce that everything between the FSSP and SSPX is alright. The reality is the FSSP is a dying organization and probably won‚Äôt exist in a decade or two, much sooner if the relationship between Rome and the SSPX is fully repaired. The reason the FSSP was founded was so those priests could have the ‚Äúsmells and bells‚Äù while compromising on principles; if the SSPX is granted personal prelature then the SSPX will have the ‚Äúsmells and bells‚Äù without needing to compromise on their principles. It also seems plausible that in that case Rome would also pull a lot of support for the FSSP and other TLM groups and basically tell all their priests they can join the SSPX or be a normal diocesan priest. However it‚Äôs highly unlikely that the SSPX will ever get personal prelature, but that still doesn‚Äôt bode well for the FSSP. The FSSP exists at the whim of the current administration of the Vatican, and they will run into the same problem that the SSPX ran into in the 80‚Äôs: unable to find a Bishop who will ordain the priests. The priests of the FSSP don‚Äôt want to be disobedient to Rome, but the reality is there‚Äôs no duty to obey an authority that commands something that is offensive to God, which is the position of the SSPX."
zl8921,FSSP and the SSPX,j04b2oy,None,4,"I've seen priests of both congregations attending events and similar things, treating each other in a cordial manner. That said, usually they don't get together, with both clergy saying the laity shouldn't attend the other, with both laity being quite vitriolic towards each other. In real life things ain't that great but are ok, but online... things often become quite uncharitable."
zl8921,FSSP and the SSPX,jc08wwq,RadTradTref,2,"I think it dependson the area. I also think it is changing for the better, at least in my area. I attend a FSSP parish. There are 2 SSPX chapels about an hour away.  One to the north and one to the south. The laity intermix all the time. I'd say about 20% of our parish live half way between the FSSP and one of the SSPX and alternate between the two. We have several family's who have very large backyard get together every year and attendance is about 40% FSSP, 40% SSPX 15% Melkite 5% NO. Usually there are close to 200 families at these parties. The priests come sometimes, mostly the FSSP and Melkite priests as well as some diocesan priests. The SSPX  priory is about 3 hours south of the general area where the parties take place.  And our kids have started to inter marry. I'd say 99% of my FSSP parish would not hesitate a second to go to the SSPX if our FSSP parish were to close. We have an unspoken don't ask don't tell policy with the priest. We don't ask if it's okay to attend the others mass so they won't tell us the official position of their respective societies."

zl8921,FSSP and the SSPX,j04wvjo,Piklikl,5,"Not really. It‚Äôs essentially the SSPX (traditional formation of priests) with the explicit acceptance of all of Vatican II. Lots of FSSP priests will claim to be critical of Vatican II, but if their local bishop comes around all of a sudden they won‚Äôt say a bad thing about it. It‚Äôs really frustrating to hear the FSSP criticize the SSPX for being disrespectful to Rome when the FSSP engages in all sorts of two faced behavior (telling Rome one thing and their faithful the complete opposite)."
zl8921,FSSP and the SSPX,j04j4bm,Piklikl,8,"Basic theology. The SSPX has always taken issue with Vatican II‚Äôs ambiguous statements regarding collegiality, religious equality, and ecumenism. Additionally, the SSPX takes issue with the seemingly deliberate changes made to the liturgy that run contrary to everything the Church taught up until the 1960‚Äôs (making the Mass a meal instead of a sacrifice, the protestantizing of the liturgy, implicit denial of the True Presence). The SSPX has never claimed to be doing ‚Äúits own thing‚Äù, only reverting to the last know good configuration. This is why the SSPX is different from other TLM-centric organizations: despite getting a lot of pushback from informed traditional Catholics the SSPX celebrates the 1962 rubrics instead earlier rubrics because that was the last change made before the sweeping liturgical changes made in the spirit of Vatican II. The founder of the SSPX (one of the fathers of Vatican II, a man formerly entrusted with the religious development of most of Africa) saw most of the members of the Church jump off a cliff after Vatican II, and the SSPX is basically just camping out on the cliff edge waiting for the rest of the Church to climb back up to where things were before the changes. The SSPX was founded in 1970, 5 years after the close of Vatican II when it was clear that the fruits of Vatican II were plummeting Mass attendance, religious vocations, and in general a decline in the health of the Church. It isn‚Äôt a stretch to say if those are the fruits of the Council, then clearly some of those changes are offensive to God."

zl8921,FSSP and the SSPX,j04nfvn,notanexpert_askapro,1,"Interesting, thanks. So is offensive to God in this case basically limited to heresy or anything that might imply heresy?"
zl8921,FSSP and the SSPX,j04q5q3,Piklikl,2,"I‚Äôm using the phrase ‚Äúoffensive to God‚Äù in a very broad sense to highlight the fact that at its core the SSPX is doing its very best to fulfill the basic tenets of religion by worshipping God the way He has told us He wants to be worshipped. Obedience to God will always trump obedience to any man. By offensive to God I don‚Äôt intend to accuse heresy, but simply point out that something is suboptimal and able to be criticized and improved. Vatican II clearly has resulted in a lot of negatives for the Church, and I think can broadly be considered offensive to God in some respects. However the hierarchy of the Church since Vatican II has effectively demonstrated that criticism of the council is intolerable and will not be considered (in fact this is always the sticking point of the current talks between the SSPX and Rome, Rome refuses to discuss the Council or elaborate on any of the problematic points). There are legitimate ways of promulgating dogma, but the current administration refuses to use those means and instead demands obedience to its contemporary whims; effectively making Vatican II dogma without actually submitting it to the scrutiny that such a declaration would demand. As it happens the SSPX was rarely attacked prior to the episcopal consecrations for its position against Vatican II, but for its adherence to the TLM and the traditional formation of priests. The episcopal consecrations were not performed in defiance of Rome, in fact Archbishop Lefebrve did everything he could to remain on good terms with Rome. Rome approved the consecrations, approved the candidates, but started giving him the run around on approving a date for the consecrations. It became clear to the Archbishop that Rome was stalling and waiting for him to die. The entire point of the Society was to form priests in the traditional manner; and this would not be possible without a traditionally minded bishop to ordain them; which is why the Archbishop made the decision to please God and offend the men in Rome and go ahead with the episcopal consecrations. The SSPX has always attempted to remain respectful to the legitimate authorities, which is why pronouncements of heresy are never given because they are not competent to judge someone as a formal heretic. The SSPX doesn‚Äôt want to steer the Church in a different direction, only put on the brakes and reverse back to the critical junction where a hard left turn was made in the 60‚Äôs to discuss the changes made by Vatican II, so in effect the SSPX is sitting back at that juncture waiting for a reasonable explanation for the changes."
zl8921,FSSP and the SSPX,j054hdr,notanexpert_askapro,1,"Thanks for this  comment. I'm confused about this:""There are legitimate ways of promulgating dogma, but the current administration refuses to use those means and instead demands obedience to its contemporary whims; effectively making Vatican II dogma without actually submitting it to the scrutiny that such a declaration would demand.""What are the legitimate ways of promulgating dogma in the context of an ecumenical council or outside that context, according to SSPX? Why was VII not a legitimate way?Btw I have issues with VII myself just been trying to wrap my head around the SSPX position."
zl8921,FSSP and the SSPX,j05ae7d,Piklikl,1,"I‚Äôm by no means an expert, but it‚Äôs always seemed strange to me how Vatican II was convened explicitly as a pastoral council (the first and only), not as a dogmatic council. The Council explicitly did not produce anything binding, it‚Äôs stated purpose was simply to discuss matters in the Church. However, the revealed preference of the hierarchy since the council has been that it is dogmatic because no one is allowed to question the Council, even to the point of heavily modifying the canonization provides specifically to get the Popes who convened the council and upheld it canonized, thus making it harder to criticize the Council. If Vatican II is effectively dogmatic, why was it not convened as such? Another example of this unwillingness to use existing methods for proclaiming the teachings of the Church was JP 2‚Äôs statement on female priests. He made the pronouncement using an almost identical formula for an ex cathedra statement (so it seemed like he was invoking the infallibility of the office); but later clarified that he didn‚Äôt intend it to be an infallible statement. In fact the last time an infallible statement was made by a Pope was the proclamation of the dogma of the Assumption in 1950 by Pius XII. So basically the Church has specific ways of demanding assent to teachings by all her members, yet the only method that the Post V2 Church seems to use is obedience (‚ÄúI said you have to follow it so you have to‚Äù). Please keep in mind that I‚Äôm a lay person, with only a cursory knowledge of the subject so I could be very wrong about all of this but it just seems strange to me that Vatican II is simply not allowed to be seriously criticized by anyone."
zl8921,FSSP and the SSPX,j07f1k9,Agathonbanitohen,1,"My understanding of why Pope Saint John XXIII convened the Council was to foster unity, within and without the Church and to find ways to evangelize the postwar world while keeping the same doctrine and same sense with a different way of saying it. The problem was that Msgr Bugnini and his allies hijacked the Council to lay the groundwork for their liturgical reforms. One aim of their reforms in the new Order of Mass was to deliberately remove obstacles to Protestant converts and make the Mass ecumenical. We can see the fruits of that. in addition, the reformers changed the theology and doctrine of the Mass with assembly theology and this repackaging the Mass as a meal. The 1969 General Instruction of the Roman Missal was a theological and doctrinal document. When the furor erupted when criticism of the General Instruction arose, the reformers slightly altered the General Instruction in the 1970 edition to make it more acceptable. One theologian said that the ‚Äú cleverness of the revisers ‚Äú ‚Äú saved ‚Äú the reforms from the ‚Äú Post Tridentine theory of sacrifice. ‚Äú"

One is that can it ever happen that a heretic gets elected. Possible answers are that no, the Church is by definition preserved from that, ergo a pope may only seem like a heretic when he in fact is not. Or yes, a heretic can manage to get elected. But then the second question is that can a heretic validly be and remain a pope. Then the possible options are yes, the faithful are just supposed to put up with it. Or no, he is automatically excommunicated and the only thing required is his physical removal by force. Or no, but the hierarchy must come to its senses and then proceed to remove the man. What if someone did not just become a heretic after the election but always was one? Roncalli was a suspected Modernist long before 1958, which would by definition make his election illegal and invalid. Also, Pius XII intentionally did not make Montini a cardinal.If the Church was hijacked by and for a different system of belief beginning in 1958 and finalized in 1969, one that it fought against for at least a century before it happened, then the question is, who or what is going to hijack it back? And are those people saved or damned who hold this alternative system of belief that the Church always strictly condemned before it took over?Then the final question is that to believe in the old way, do you only need the TLM and the old sacraments or do you need something more? According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, Traditionalism is a condemned heresy. Put in everyman's terms it means that people are saved by participating in the right kind of appearances.Then, Sedevacantism is an idea. Sedevacantists are a bunch of people running a very messy shadow hierarchy. Sedevacantism the idea does not necessarily make Sedevacantists the people valid in any way. This is the interesting thing with their so-called Thesis. It is a stratagem to ""steal"" validity for episcopal consecrations from (according to them) a licit but invalid pope. Who, they say, possess the title but not the power. As far as I know, the SSPX thinks the recent popes are illicit but valid. They possess the power but not the title.I think the most important question is if you can save your soul in Novus Ordo? FSSP? SSPX? Or any of the myriad Sede shops?Another way to put this is if in the Church the human element exists for the spiritual, or the spiritual element for the human? If the spiritual element is not there, then what's the point in the human element? Or is the human element the really important one and the spiritual in a way optional?"

yxuxbm,Why be SSPX? Why Latin mass?,iwqtvy6,Piklikl,19,"Nobody in the SSPX or who attend the SSPX chapels for the sacraments seriously claims to be more Catholic than the Pope. It‚Äôs very bad form for you to be begging the question like that, but I‚Äôll attempt to answer your other questions. The reason most of the faithful attend the SSPX masses probably comes down to the Catholic principle of ‚Äúlex orandi, lex credendi‚Äù, which is the integral relationship between the manner of worship and the quality of ones faith: a poor manner of praying will undoubtedly result in a poor faith. The Traditional Latin Mass is a rite that has developed from the Last Supper through nearly 2000 years, **slowly** codified and developed into the form we know today; it is the rite that the vast majority of saints would recognize. And then men who happened to be alive decided that they knew much better than the centuries of other men (many of them saints) who came before them, tossed it all out the window and (even deliberately one might suspect) decided a bastardized version was much better and would usher in a new springtime of the Church. The SSPX was founded by one of the fathers of the Second Vatican Council, Archbishop Marcel Lefebrve. He was the former Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers at the time when it was one of the largest missionary orders and effectively made him the spiritual father of the entire continent of Africa. During his tenure the continent saw record numbers of baptisms, and also ordinations as he established several seminaries. Pope John XXIII moved him from Apostolic Delegate in Africa to Rome as a member of the Central Preparatory Commission for Vatican II. All that is to say the founder of the SSPX was himself a fruit of the traditional way of preparing priests, and had a literal front row seat at the table when this way was completely overturned and could see the terrible fruits of the Novus Ordo and how they stem directly from the poor, haphazard way of forming priests. He founded the SSPX in order to transmit what he had received, which was the traditional formation of a priest as it had been done for centuries (the phrase ‚ÄúI have transmitted what I have received‚Äù is on his gravestone) up until the men moved by the spirit of Vatican II saw fit to toss it all out. The SSPX is not doing anything new or unprompted, heck the SSPX gets tons of flack from diocesan traditional Catholics for not being ‚Äútraditional enough‚Äù because they celebrate the TLM with the 1962 rubrics to make it clear they will obey Rome in all that is not dangerous to the faith. The steep drop off in practicing Catholics post NO implementation is a clear indicator of how dangerous the NO is to ones faith. There is nothing wrong with celebrating and having a preference for the TLM, the SSPX is the only organization that has made it even possible (every single priest who celebrates it today will trace their training back to the SSPX, the founders of all the TLM organizations in the Church today are all former SSPX). I strongly recommend you devote 1:44 of your time to watch this documentary and learn about the founder of the SSPX. https://youtu.be/Cf9oy7wDkms"
yxuxbm,Why be SSPX? Why Latin mass?,ixbfx9e,Sneedevacantist,4,"The choice is either the Mass of the ages or the Protestant worship service trying to imitate a Catholic Mass. Gee, I wonder why Catholics want the Latin Mass..."
yxuxbm,Why be SSPX? Why Latin mass?,iwt7tti,AndrzejGieralt,3,"I would like to ask how much research or inquiry you did about the topic to begin with, because the ""be more Catholic than the Pope"" comment feels kind of in bad faith? If you didn't intend it that way I apologize but the question comes off as though you already think you have an answer in mind. 1. Why Latin Mass - the New Mass was designed to appeal to Protestants, the architect of this Mass was not hiding about this, citations are plentiful about this. The texts and actions are diminished in the New Mass and at times entirely replaced and invented. The offertory of the New Mass is a meal prayer from I believe the Talmud, whereas the original offertory speaks of offering this Spotless Host, offered by an Unworthy Servant, the priest, for the salvation of sinners. In the New Mass, the Eucharist is often spoken of as bread, and Christ's arrival is alluded to in future tense as though he wasn't here with us - trained Catholics understand these as metaphors, but many uninformed Catholics don't, and think the Eucharist is not Christ. 2. Why the SSPX and not any other Latin Mass? Because they pull no punches. They don't agree to dangerous ambiguity, they don't agree to obey a legitimate and true authority that tells them to do something that is demonstrably against Church teaching or damaging to the faithful, and therefore against the will of God. Most other groups seem to be willing to compromise and, although they do so in good faith, and I'm sure most/all/many of them are blameless in this, it's not something I can agree to for myself."

yo1f97,Dialogue with SSPX,ivci58n,MarcellusFaber,9,"The human element of the Church has been infected with Modernism, and hence we are in a crisis. Since priests are obliged to provide the Faithful with the Sacraments (which are necessary for salvation), and since the Faithful cannot receive the Sacraments from priests who do not believe in the Catholic religion (who are Modernists) unless in danger of death, and since the highest law of the Church is the salvation of souls, it would not make sense for the Faithful to be deprived of the Sacraments for the sake of bureaucracy. Canon law concerning the Sacraments exists in order to ensure that the Sacraments are administered properly, by a properly trained priest, and who is under a Catholic bishop in normal times. However, we are not in normal times, and it would be turning the law on its head to use it to prevent the Faithful from receiving the Sacraments at all, which would be the result. It is a principle of canon law that a law ceases to apply when it becomes harmful, which it would in this circumstance. Supplied jurisdiction applies considering the situation that we are in, which is the Society's main justification.If one compares mainstream 'Catholicism' with Catholicism as it was in the past, one finds that the recent Popes have been teaching things greatly contradictory to tradition. Since Catholicism is based on tradition, this is something of a problem. For example, throughout the ages the Church has been against the proposition that ""Every man is free to embrace and profess that religion which, guided by the light of reason, he shall consider true"" (from Pius IX's Syllabus of Errors; errors 77 and 78 are also good examples). This is not what is taught any longer. Oecumenism is practiced very publicly by the Popes and encouraged, but this was forbidden throughout the Church's history as communicatio in sacris with heretics and schismatics is indifferentist (it implicitly teaches that all religions are just as good as one another), offensive to God (for God has decreed that he should be worshipped using Catholic rites), and a mortal sin. This quote from the Oath Against Modernism is useful in showing the problem: ""I accept sincerely the doctrine of faith transmitted from the apostles through the orthodox fathers, always in the same sense and interpretation, even to us; and so I reject the heretical invention of the evolution of dogmas, passing from one meaning to another, different from that which the Church first had"". The whole oath is here: [traditionalcatholic.net/Tradition/Prayer/Modernism\_Oath.html](https://traditionalcatholic.net/Tradition/Prayer/Modernism_Oath.html)I recommend that you read through the Syllabus of Errors, the decrees of the Pontifical Biblical Commission of 1909, and any teaching prior to the 1960's. You will find that it is very different in these important areas to that of to-day. I also recommend the SSPX podcast, which goes over these problems in detail."

The society was, in fact, never separated from it, given that what led to the excomunication or suspention *a divinis* (someone please correct me if I'm using wrong terminology) had no valid reason at its basis, and thus were invalid. Indeed, the Society never did anything heretical, but kept practicing Holy Tradition without conforming to the wordly spirit of Vatican II and the protestant spirit of the NO mass. Furthermore, you must know that the Society never rejected Vatican II as a whole, but only the parts of it that were clearly in contraddiction with the faith, tradition or previous teachings (such as St. Pope Pious V's *Quo Primum*, according to which the Mass cannot be radically changed). As a matter of fact, Archbishop Lefebvre implemented the pastoral indications on education that came from the council in his seminaries.In any case, if you want to better understand the situation from the SSPX's perspective, I advice you read *An Open Letter to Confused Catholics* by Archbishop Lefebvre, where he explains he decisions he had to take."

Lefebvre and saints such as Athanasius or Augustine, some of the laity attached to them calling him a saint... some might see no problem in this, or maybe defend them, but that's too much for me.Sure, much changed since Benedict lifted the excommunications and Francis gave them some jurisdictions, yet there's a long road ahead."

yo1f97,Dialogue with SSPX,ivdjib8,feelinggravityspull,5,"I appreciate this comment. I don‚Äôt agree with it all, but I can definitely appreciate where you‚Äôre coming from. There are certainly some SSPX positions I don‚Äôt think are fully accurate. But, for me, the pros far outweigh the cons. I‚Äôve been happily attending an SSPX parish for about 5 years now, and I can honestly say I haven‚Äôt found such a robust Catholic spirituality anywhere else. The priests are consistently well-formed, the preaching is generally terrific, and there is a lively and warm sense of community.The priests are *priests*, first and foremost. They aren‚Äôt activists or rad-trad warriors. They are men who are striving to live holy lives and shepherd their flock to the same end.Are there problems? Sure. But there are problems everywhere in the Church. And when I compare my current parish with the alternatives and think about what would be best for my family, it‚Äôs really a no-brainer to stick with the Society‚Äîeven if I keep certain things at arm‚Äôs length."
yo1f97,Dialogue with SSPX,ivfqfbi,AndrzejGieralt,2,"Hello. I was wondering, did you determine that those positions troubled you after you inquired further with your priests about their deeper reasoning, and determined that reasoning was false, or did it simply rub you the wrong way?I had similar concerns, but I discussed my many questions and possible objections with multiple priests, and found the logic to be airtight. I mean, of course we should avoid the Novus Ordo, since they were designed to work against the will of God by admission of the architects (i.e. remove all stumbling blocks for the Protestants, aka make the Catholic truth less clear, aka create scandal). The 1988 excommunications couldn't have been valid due to the detailed legal requirements of a laetae sententiae excommunication on the grounds used as claim against the Archbishop. The comparisons are indeed quite similar to those saints you mentioned, however I am concerned about calling the Archbishop a saint while simultaneously doubting other official canonizations. I think that position needs to be consistent, and you can maintain his heroism and inquire for his intercession while not making any theological claims about his objective sainthood. Unless I misunderstand, and a saint here refers to any holy soul in heaven or purgatory, and it is more so saying ""we believe this is the case"" rather than ""we make the objective claim that this is in fact the case, and declare a mock canonization"" - I believe the prior is quite consistent."
yo1f97,Dialogue with SSPX,ivcrmea,None,-2,Ratzinger isn't even Catholic. Who cares what he thinks?
yo1f97,Dialogue with SSPX,ivmgucv,Sneedevacantist,3,"I also don't agree with the SSPX on everything, but they have valid priests offering valid Masses and sacraments, so I don't mind attending at their chapels for my Sunday obligation. I'm just glad that the chapel that I've been attending at is very traditional, welcoming, and has a wonderful, devout priest. The future of Catholicism is traditionalism."
yo1f97,Dialogue with SSPX,ivgcdrg,JackStone2112,2,"I second this post, especially the point that at an SSPX chapel, the pros outweigh the cons.   If a Bishop is yammering on about improper incardination of SSPX priests while allowing communion in the hand, encouraging the participation of yoga pants-wearing extraordinary ministers, and dropping the word ""sinners"" from the Hail Mary,  I'll entrust my and my family's souls with the good priests of the SSPX.  (All these examples are my first-hand experiences with the diocesean church.)"
yo1f97,Dialogue with SSPX,ivg1nnh,None,1,"These positions actually troubled me for years, and after listening to homilies, reading some of their books and chatting here and there with SSPX priests, they became ""stronger"". The moment I realized something was deeply wrong happened during a first communion, when the local prior, while talking about John Paul II, said that ""a man like that cannot be a saint"", and the first thing that came to my mind was a strong urge to leave that place right away. If you are asking if I sat with them one day and brought forth my concerns, the answer is yes, many times actually, and for different reasons and questions.BTW, just looked into your game on Steam, and might have a look on it after a couple of rounds of HOI4 as emperor Haile Selassie."
yo1f97,Dialogue with SSPX,ivgdj8t,JackStone2112,1,"Isn't praying for a non-saint's intercession a necessary condition for that soul to be declared a saint?  So why not pray for Archbishop LeFebvre's intercessions to resolve, say, the current crisis in the Church?"

yo1f97,Dialogue with SSPX,ivdctci,feelinggravityspull,2,"OP, **this comment does not reflect the position of the SSPX**. At all."
yo1f97,Dialogue with SSPX,ivg9bxt,AndrzejGieralt,2,"Thanks for explaining :) And thanks a lot I really appreciate that! Not sure which game but I suspect you mean Heir Obscure :)Would you be able to elaborate about your objections to why the SSPX hold in doubt that Pope John Paul II is a legitimately canonized saint? I understand taking issue with that as a reaction, however I'm not clear what the actual dispute about the reasons are. Because I think the arguments are very strong, which is that the process of canonization was dumbed down, putting things into doubt to begin with, emphasizing that doubt by holding Pope John Paul up as an example of Catholic heroic virtue, while having done some extremely troubling scandalous things, particularly the Assisi meetings, and the various encouragements of false religions. Similar examples include Mother Theresa seemingly having claimed to encourage those in false faiths to remain in their false faiths. These individuals, although having done naturally heroic things, many of their significant public actions cause this kind of scandal, and can't be considered an example to follow. People might downplay those acts and focus on the heroic acts, or they might be so bothered by the scandalous acts that they really don't like the individuals (myself being Polish I highly value the heroic acts of the Pope while being fully convinced of the error of the mentioned scandals), the objective deeds and judgment of the actions of the individuals can't be accepted as an example of heroic virtue. Because canonizations don't just declare ""this individual is in heaven,"" and the way it was explained to me is that the SSPX doesn't make any claims whether they are or not, but they hold the canonizations in doubt, and reject that these individuals should be venerated as heroic ideal examples of the Christian life."
yo1f97,Dialogue with SSPX,ivgi6fv,AndrzejGieralt,1,"If that's the case then, yeah that makes sense. I think you're right because I've heard about it having to be a localized veneration first? So yeah that's a good point in case anybody was going to say they're hypocritical or something."
yo1f97,Dialogue with SSPX,ivhi0w3,None,2,"He's a classic example of a modernist, sorry if you disagree but you're wrong."
yo1f97,Dialogue with SSPX,iveb045,MarcellusFaber,3,"He was a peritus at the Council, very much a Modernist, and engaged in false oecumenism extensively during his pontificate, and probably before that. The last point alone would be enough to make him suspect of heresy in normal times. He praised and studied the work of Teilhard de Chardin, an arch-Modernist. Now, if Modernism isn't Catholic, which we know it not to be (read Lamentabili Sane, Pascendi Domini Gregis), then it seems to follow that Modernists aren't Catholic either. I'm afraid the conclusion follows common sense."
yo1f97,Dialogue with SSPX,ivhdme1,None,3,"OP, **this comment reflects common sense**, to say Ratzinger is anything other than a modernist is gaslighting yourself and pure cope. Also Abp. Lefebvre literally said JP2's conciliar church wasn't even Catholic (logically by extension neither would JP2 be Catholic), why would Benedict be anything different?‚ÄúTo whatever extent pope, bishops, priests or faithful adhere to this new Church, they separate themselves from the Catholic Church.‚Äù (July 29, 1976, Reflections on the Suspension a divinis)‚ÄúI should be very happy to be excommunicated from this Conciliar Church‚Ä¶ It is a Church that I do not recognize.

It‚Äôs impossible‚Ä¶ For the moment they are in rupture with their predecessors. This is impossible. They are no longer in the Catholic Church.‚Äù (Retreat Conference, September 4, 1987, Ec√¥ne)"
yo1f97,Dialogue with SSPX,ivgjp06,None,1,"My main objection is the questioning of a canonization itself, something I understand to be infalible. Sure, many will bring up countless articles explaining how supposedly it ain't infalible, or how the process became falible after being watered down, but I find this questioning of the sancity of others, or, what seems to happen with the SSPX, accepting saint A while criticising the whole process and denying saint B, problematic. If the post-1983 saints are questionable because the old process was abandoned, what about the saints of the first centuries of the Church, such as George or Cosmas and Damian, should we question them too?I remeber when I translated an article of the SSPX's version of St. Maximilian Kolbe's Militiae, and gave to a priest to review, just to have it back with the title *Saint* being changed to mere *Father.*Again I might be stoned by many here, but if John Paul or Theresa ain't saints because of these scandals, which I do recognize as sad and grave, why stand for the sanctity of Abp. Lefebvre, who also caused scandle in 1988 and in other opportunities by attacking the popes and the Church?"
yo1f97,Dialogue with SSPX,ivo8w5b,AndrzejGieralt,1,"So it's a very good point for sure, however it missed a few major significant distinctions. I don't know if the canonization process is meant to be infallible or not but it definitely makes sense that it would have been. However, if that process is then reduced, changed, treated with much less gravity, and seemingly used to justify and raise up people who would support some poor positions made in the Church, and we can observe objectively that people who did not display heroic virtue getting canonized, one simply cannot look at that and say 2+2=5 - it is clear that SOMETHING is wrong, and one doesn't have to make any claims definitely there other than simply acknowledging that fact. Something is wrong with the new process.Can you ""accept"" Saint A vs Saint B - well, no. However, you CAN venerate and ask for the intercession of holy men who happened to be canonized despite doubting the process, for example Padre Pio. Archbishop Lefebvre is included in this as well, because I mean, if you follow an order you better believe the founder of your order was a man of strong, heroic faith. And you hope for the canonization of these people while praying for their intercession, piously believing they are in Heaven despite not being given that certainty. That's fine. And it doesn't change the fact that you can't venerate anywhere near the same level individuals who supported and enacted ecumenical movements, for example.Why are Archbishop Lefebvre's actions different from Pope John Paul II and Mother Theresa? Well, I know more about the Pope so I will focus on that, but it has to do with what a scandal is. A Pope cannot in any capacity pray with non-believers, pagans, heretics, and schismatics, and cannot affirm their false faith. THIS is a scandal, because it causes people to believe that this is OK to do, and it is even more grave because it is the Pope who is doing it. Scandal means leading people into sin, and allowing false worship, encouraging it, approving it, is by definition enabling and encouraging sin, and at that, in a most public way.Whether the Archbishop caused a scandal is up for debate, you might believe it is a scandal, but if you had initially been in the SSPX than I am surprised that you would. The Archbishop wouldn't lead anyone into sin if his position is true, that is, that one cannot obey a command to do evil, and that the commands given to him were in fact to do evil. This disobedience would in fact be heroic and a good example worthy of admiration. In any case, no one is claiming Archbishop Lefebvre as having been somehow canonized independently of the due process, while still exercising their legitimate veneration of the admirable founder of their order."
yo1f97,Dialogue with SSPX,ivqyfn7,None,1,"Sure, recently some individuals have being admited to the calendar of the saints, and while their personal sanctity might have being verified, one wonder what heroic virtue they displayed. But this could also be used against trads, specially those who want to see people such as Chesterton or Columbus raised to the glory of our altars. But, at least to me, this is far beyond our, or the society's paygrade.But this dualism is often seeing within the SSPX, with the veneration of holy men such as Padre Pio, St. Charbel or the Martin, not questioning their canonization, while ignoring others, and questioning their canonization and the whole process, that they dislike. I recall a prior's homily, the same one who said John Paul II wasn't a saint, saying that the Vatican became a ""saint factory"".And don't be surprised, for actually I tried to ignore these facts whenever they came up, following the usual SSPX mentality: check what the priests, Lefebvre, websites and books say, accept these arguments and ignore whatever is said against us, for they are all modernists and members of a new church. With time I began to listen and see the validity, the reality of the claims and arguments against the society, Abp. Lefebvre, the positions they hold."
yo1f97,Dialogue with SSPX,ivr73ub,AndrzejGieralt,1,"""But, at least to me, this is far beyond our, or the society's paygrade."" - but don't you yourself at least see the distinction between the veneration of holy men (claiming no official/certain canonized status for them) while doubting the innovations of the new process? You seem to have said nothing to address my points about all the distinctions I presented."" I recall a prior's homily, the same one who said John Paul II wasn't a saint, saying that the Vatican became a ""saint factory""."" - I would ask, what is ultimately wrong with this claim, besides you personally not liking it? What arguments convinced you that the SSPX is wrong besides a gut feeling?""I tried to ignore these facts whenever they came up"" I suppose that's on you I'm afraid, but I think we've quite arrived at the point where these ""facts"" would prove most useful to unpacking the actual reasons for your change of mind. Hopefully you can explain to me the reasoning that led you to change your mind."
yo1f97,Dialogue with SSPX,ivtqju5,None,1,"The process ain't flawed because somethings were changed here and there, to question a canonization is because one considers that they are being treated as a ""badge of honor"" for those who supported whatever changes that happened after Vatican II is a weak and feable position... what's wrong with admitting the personal sanctity of the recent popes, or non TLM clergy?First, to say that the Vatican, the See of Peter, became a ""saint factory"", sound terribly protestant to many, not just me. Second, if we lived in a parallel universe, and Rome began canonizing countless SSPX'ers, would they make the same critic? Maybe this ""gut feeling"" was my sensus fidei reacting towards clear signs of schismatic mentality.Actually this quite common within the laity attached to the SSPX, to ignore whatever criticism while accepting everything that comes from the clergy, without complaining or questioning. And, to make matters worst, whosoever don't follow their arguments are dismissed as mere ""legalists""."
yo1f97,Dialogue with SSPX,ivtzuu1,AndrzejGieralt,1,"""Actually this quite common within the laity attached to the SSPX, to ignore whatever criticism while accepting everything that comes from the clergy"" - to be frank, this is insulting, especially since you have seemed not to attempt to offer any criticism beyond your ""gut feeling"". ""The process ain't flawed because somethings were changed here and there \[...\] what's wrong with admitting the personal sanctity of the recent popes, or non TLM clergy?"" - this is a bad faith strawman - you sound as though you don't even know the specific changes made to the canonization process, which, I'm assuming you do know what the changes are since you stated you've done your due diligence. And, no one says ""admitting the personal sanctity"" etc is ""wrong"" lol - you're completely ignoring the cases made against these individual's heroic virtue worthy of canonization.This would be more fruitful if you would respond to my recounting of the distinctions i.e. the actual issues with the character of the individuals being canonized not being compatible with the definition of a canonized saint, veneration of holy men despite not needing to claim they are in fact canonized or pseudo-canonized, etc."
yo1f97,Dialogue with SSPX,ivuaxzv,None,1,"Let's be honest here, you won't convince me that the SSPX is right and Abp. Lefebvre was correct, nor am I going to convince you of the contrary. Maybe we should just depart in good spirits."
yo1f97,Dialogue with SSPX,ivuetsr,AndrzejGieralt,1,"I wasn't trying to convince you, I wanted to begin to understand your actual reasoning... to see what thought process led you to conclude the SSPX is wrong... I didn't think you were trying to convince me either. It's up to you if you want to continue the discussion or not."

Apostasy is obvious as he promotes worship of earth goddess.(Pachamama) Catholics need to see the truth and open theirs eyes; blinded by an obedience to a systematic acceptance of freemasonry and satanic teachings. The heresy of Francis can be seen as obstinate to the dogma of the Catholic Church. He has been corrected by Cardinals, and he persists in propagating error. This man is a formal, manifest heretic.There is evidence to support Pope Benedict XVI as a legitimate successor to the papacy even though he has made some erroneous pronouncements which show him to be also in heresy, but only material heresy. You could also include the other councilor‚ÄôPopes‚Äô in this category; because they all were modernist heretics who committed grave errors against ‚Äòde fide‚Äô dogma of the Church. Especially the sin of religious indifference. These ‚ÄòPopes‚Äô were all modernists: John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul I, John Paul II, and Benedict XVI. They all committed the sin of false ecumenism. These shameful false teachers have lead many astray, to twist the faith into a freemasonic and satanic sect of Catholicism which breaks completely with Sacred Tradition:‚ÄúIt firmly believes, professes and preaches that all those who are outside the catholic church, not only pagans but also Jews or heretics and schismatics, cannot share in eternal life and will go into the everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels, unless they are joined to the catholic church before the end of their lives;‚Äù{Pope Eugene IV, Council of Florence, Cantate Domino, 1441, ex cathedra}We must do more than recognize and resist. For by following in obedience to these errors, we are in complicity with falsehood and evil. By submitting to Francis as a legitimate Pope, we are giving him authority which he has ipso facto relinquished by his obstinate heresy.

xwx8b8,Chaldean Catholic Church's Sacraments,ir9vgfh,Highwayman90,2,"Also, for more general Eastern information, I know that most Byzantine Churches were at least latinized (not necessarily modernized), but a lot of that has been undone.One exception is that the Ruthenian Church had a proper liturgical reform, so I know that more traditional Byzantines might prefer the Melkite or Romanian Churches here in the US.As for other non-Byzantine Easterners, we don‚Äôt have too many Coptic or Ethiopian Catholics in the US, but the Copts are mildly latinized yet pretty traditional here where I live in Nashville.Syro-Malabars are heavily latinized and until recently were fully versus populum, but ironically Pope Francis and the Major Archbishop of the Syro-Malabar Church George Alencherry pushed through a reform to make (I think) the Liturgy of the Eucharist ad orientem.I don‚Äôt know enough about the other Churches to comment, as I haven‚Äôt been to their liturgies."

xoz3k7,Third Order,iq1c03t,None,3,"No TV means no TV at all, even if you are going to use it only for watching good movies... I remember how the laity, even non tertiaries, where encouraged to remove their TVs from home, for even owning one might be a ""near occasion of sin"", or you might give ways to corrupt your children. Though, here's what I've found in a website against the ""new"" SSPX:Regina Coeli Report: Does this mean the occasional film violates the spirit of the Tertiaries?    Fr. Adam Purdy (Chaplain of tertiaries): I would simply answer no! This is particularly the case if the film is a good presentation of some virtue, nobility or character, or religious theme. Purely mundane or vulgar themes would definitely violate the spirit of the founder. They are deconstructive in nature. Someone will surely question what is meant by occasional. If it is more than once a week, I believe it is too much."
xoz3k7,Third Order,iq2x1e8,Piklikl,2,"The SSPX moves fairly slowly with its updates on terminology, I think it's best to understand the spirit of the law (which is a typical Catholic strategy). My understanding is the Third Order is more of a local community thing, so it would make sense to see what your local Third Order members do. For better or worse, few priests make a distinction between passive viewing and channel surfing when it comes to TV (essentially time wasting) or intentional viewing of content on a device that happens to be referred to as a TV. This is largely because the priests themselves have little time to even think about doing these kinds of things, sort of like how the priest's advice on social media can be a bit out of touch because so few of them actually use it. I think a case can be made that cable TV has no place in the Catholic home due to the lack of control over what is played over it (especially when it comes to ads), but also I think Catholics need to remember that the list of things that absolutely must happen in order to get to heaven is pretty short."

xoz3k7,Third Order,iq1tf0c,None,1,"I don't know, for usually those who join this third order already have family members who follow and support the SSPX, at least that's what I always believed. Maybe those ""alone"" in this discard their own tv's and avoid the ones owned by others in the house... no idea.As for the new rule, I can't say much, for I don't know it and I'm no longer an SSPXer, but I remember homilies where we were called to leave facebook, twitter, whatever, and quit the internet, only using it out of necessity. Also, the local priory published an article written by a French SSPX priest, calling for people to remove all screens from their bedrooms."

Yes, we have no part, nullam partem habemus, with the pantheon of the religions of Assisi; our ownexcommunication by a decree of Your Eminence or of another Roman Congregation would only be theirrefutable proof of this. We ask for nothing better than to be declared out of communion with this adulterousspirit which has been blowing in the Church for the last 25 years; we ask for nothing better than to be declaredoutside of this impious communion of the ungodly. We believe in the One God, Our Lord Jesus Christ, with theFather and the Holy Ghost, and we will always remain faithful to His unique Spouse, the One Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church."

It's also worthy of mention that the priests responsible for the chapel placed a wooden box right at the entrance with all sorts of black and white veils for those that had none.That said, I've also seen very few women not wearing veils, or wearing pants, and they weren't disturbed by those attending Mass, and one or two were actually talking to the priests. In the end, I believe it would make a good impression to go with a veil."

wm09aw,What‚Äôs the society of St. Josaphat?,ijwjiy3,None,3,"I'll just copy/paste what I posted a few months ago when someone asked about an Eastern SSPX in r/EasternCatholic:Many say the Society of St. Josaphat, but I see it like this: St. Josaphat's only seek to maintain Latinizations brought or enforced to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church after the Union of Brest, while the SSPX wishes to restore and maintain Latin traditions as they existed for centuries and centuries in the Roman Catholic Church, before Vatican II and later reforms. Not to mention that SSPX leaders often meet and are in contact with Roman authorities, from Bishops to Popes, meanwhile St. Josaphat's have no link or whatsoever with his Beatitude Sviatoslav Shevchuk and the UGCC.I know several SSPX'ers admire and support them, seeing them as equals in the East, yet... things ain't that simple."
wm09aw,What‚Äôs the society of St. Josaphat?,ik1vol7,PESH28,3,"The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priestly_Society_of_Saint_Josaphat) on the [Society of St Josaphat](https://www.saintjosaphat.org/) is actually a quite decent summary. The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC) seems to be quite hostile to them, more than so than some random Latin diocesan bishops saying the SSPX are in schism, with talk of eradicating Lefebrvrists and multiple excommunications of SSJK superior [Fr Basil Kovpak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Kovpak) confirmed by Rome. The article suggests the UGCC is utterly Ukrainian turning away Russian or Russian speaking Orthodox priests discerning conversion (although there can be no doubting of their patriotism while UA faces Russian invasion).  The SSJK anyhow follow the same SSPX line of professed loyalty to Rome but rejecting Modernism and Indifferentism. However, unlike SG Dom Pagliarini, I don't see Fr Kovpak dropping into Pope Francis for a chat (the Pope was Ordinary of Buenos Aires while Fr Pagliarini was the local SSPX seminary rector)  as happened with the SSPX SG. There is a clearer recognition of the SSPX vis √° vis Rome compared to SSJK and either Rome or Ukrainian UGCC authorities."

If not in official schism, pretty close.These Latinizations, particularly stations of the cross in parishes, Eucharistic adoration, kneeling and group rosarys were added after the Union of Brest in 1596, so you can imagine some Ukrainians are fond of these Latin traditions. When, after Vatican II, the Eastern churches were encouraged to go after their own traditions, you had some unhappy with this decision. Some sources also mention the change of the usage of Church Slavonic to vernacular in Divine Liturgy as one of the causes for the creation of this priestly society.And yes, I believe the vast majority oppose Latinizations, but you also have a minority quite fond of them... in my Melkite parish they pray the rosary before DL."

w3u2hx,Prayers for Savannah,jgywxuu,AbFideFidelis,1,"Hello, the problem is, as you said, that : "" SSPX chapel or mission has ever been sent by the official church"". The status of the SSPX are abrogated since the 70s, and even these statues were limited in the Diocese of Fribourg and for six years.The Church can't teach heresy. SSPX has no mission in the Church, and it spreads many errors and even heresies. As I said, it is a catholic dogma that canonical mission is required for the legitimate ministry (Council of Trent, sess. 23, can. 7), and as said all theologians, bishops, etc : it is the meaning of the dogma. So the Universal Ordinary Magisterium also taught this dogma as I said, and you can't say that ""you don't understand the meaning of the dogma"", because the Church understands it as I said.I am not a modernist, and I believe in all dogmas of the Church. You believe that TLM is so good that no external circumstances can render this Mass bad ; but first I never said that all TLM Masses endanger souls ; second, yes, Masses (either TLM, Novus Ordo or Oriental) said by not canonically sent priests are bad for souls, not because of the rite itself, but precisely because it is said by an illegitimate priest, so it is an illegitimate Mass.You commit the sin of slander towards me when you say that I'm a protestant. Also, I don't understand your last sentence. If you believe that I'm interested into converting to sedevacantism, that's false (btw it denies the same dogma as I said above), but if I'm interested by it, it is because it is a schism and a corpus of heretical doctrines that needs to be refuted."

It‚Äôs also not uncommon for one parent to receive, go back and hold the baby while the other parent goes up, particularly if the baby tends to get really fussy in line.

Attendance at SSPX parishes in general has always been on the rise, but that‚Äôs due to a number of factors: people moving from other areas, families growing, leaving the NO. Also in recent times, the Covid restrictions probably led to an increase in attendance. All these things would need to be controlled for in order to understand the causes. I‚Äôm sure the declarations made by the Holy Father confirming the validity of the SSPX sacraments has also led to an increase in attendance, so it‚Äôs not all bad."

vawlmy,How to address issues with past papacies,ic8lvk2,parsonpilgrim,2,"Protestants are about to have their own reckoning with failed leadership, sex abuse scandals and coverups going back decades. It‚Äôs ongoing right now. If their faith is based on the personal holiness of individual Christians, then they‚Äôre probably going to completely lose their faith soon and they‚Äôre just throwing shade on Catholics. Answering your question specifically, the infallibility of the Pope does not mean they are without fault, only that his specific ministry in the Church provides a negative guarantee that he will not teach error as Truth formally and in his role as Pope. We‚Äôve had some notoriously bad popes. I say the present Pope is pretty bad. Not necessarily because of his moral life, but because of his theological confusion, yet we see the charism playing out even here, when Francis says things confusing or puts forward a heretical teaching as a personal opinion or off-hand remark, its doesn‚Äôt cross that important line. Even in the Encyclicals, the verbiage is confusing, odd, and mostly unclear, or problems appear in footnotes rather than the main text. It is no small miracle that while we probably have a personally heretical pope, yet he hasn‚Äôt made himself a Material Heretic by formally proclaiming a theologically unsound teaching. It‚Äôs almost as if something [or someone] is stopping him. The Holy Spirit is at work with what we give the Church to work with ‚Äî which is sadly lacking."

upn3fj,Can a NO mass or FSSP mass fulfill Sunday Obligation?,ig49pv7,Highwayman90,1,"I know people have mentioned Eastern liturgies, and as someone moving toward Byzantine Catholicism, I have some thoughts here:1. Remember that the slightly different wording of the Creed is a more ancient one and it DOES NOT deny the essential doctrine of the Filioque but rather excludes it from the Creed, which even early Popes supported doing until the Frankish Kings pushed for its inclusion.2. The Divine Liturgy is beautiful; savor it!3. All of this said, I'd recommend that you ensure that certain traditional practices are followed to prevent yourself from being scandalized:   1. Make sure there's an iconostasis (even if it's not much... some Eastern parishes are dirt poor).   2. Make sure the Eucharist is dispensed in the traditional means (by intinction, from a communion chalice with a spoon); I saw something in this comment section about Dixie cups and was quite disappointed.   3. I'd pick Melkite, Ukrainian, or Romanian over Ruthenian if possible; the new Ruthenian liturgical books use gender-neutral language when describing mankind, and while I believe some of their priests may still use the old books, it's rather disappointing.   4. As for non-Byzantine Eastern Churches, know that they tend to be more modernized/Latinized. Syro-Malabar, Chaldean, and Maronite Catholics are especially so. I believe that Syriacs, Syro-Malankaras, and some of the smaller ones (a few Russian parishes and an Italo-Greek parish under other particular Churches' jurisdictions) are probably less latinized or modernized.Anyway, thanks for coming to my Eastern TED Talk ;)"

The problem with the Novus Ordo is that it constitutes, in origin and content, a substantial break with the Catholic faith.

un7co8,What is the traditional method of forming priests?,i86adjb,Piklikl,6,"The ‚Äúold way‚Äù typically refers to 8 years or so of formation in the seminary, with minor and major orders conferred. The changes of seminary formation brought on by Vatican II resulted in a much lower quality of priests, pedophiles intentionally becoming priests because of how easy it became, and overall a crisis of priests not really knowing what they were doing. Thankfully it seems as though the quality of priests in the NO are improving, but the SSPX has always had high caliber results because that was Archbishop Lefebrve‚Äôs specialty (running seminaries)."
un7co8,What is the traditional method of forming priests?,i88ztws,None,3,"Theologically, the confusion of Vatican II brought about a line of thought that we no longer needed to ground our thought in St. Thomas, but in in the ""New Theology"" which could include whatever the professor wanted. Thus, biblical professors taught protestant interpretations of scripture. Seminarians were told to not trust St. Thomas. Rahner was prevalent in seminary formation.To be fair, much of this way of training seminarians is fading away in diocesan seminaries. Professors are again turning to Thomas and the fathers, but there is still a long way to go. Right now, Ratzinger and Von Balthasar are in vogue, which are lesser evils, but still do not have the accuracy or consistency of St. Thomas. I predict that in 20 years, Thomas will have his rightful place in seminaries, at least in the U.S. (where I'm from).&#x200B;tl;dr The new method is more vague; Thomas and the old way are clear; diocesan seminaries are slowly returning to Thomas."

The sana doctrina of doctor angelicus, books of good authors combined with life of prayer was something essential to his vision. Also from the practical point of view Mons. Lefev was shocked to hear, that in other seminaries no one cares for the morals of seminarians, leaving them to leave and enter at every hour of day and night.&#x200B;To sum up, for Mons. Lefev had seminary those pillars: doctrine, order and prayer."

ujdpn3,What led you guys to SSPX?,i7tc4s2,None,3,"To make the story short: I was raised like classical Novus Ordo catholic, then I started going from time to time to Traditional mass, but mostly on the Novus Ordo. As the modernism progressed in the parish, everyone stopped kneeling when walking around the tabernacle, but I kept kneeling. Then I had dispute with the local priest, where he insisted that I should only bow and not kneel anymore. In the parish was also stationed one old very old pious priest from good old Slovakia, who also kept kneeling, even though it had caused him immense pain. So I knew that the young priest was just pushing against catholic practice. After having basically the same dispute with local bishop, I decided to go for TLM only since, and I never had to regret.While the NO world is just disassembling itself, tradition keeps growing.  SSPX is the only public TLM in the diocese."

u3fxe7,Was my Easter confession valid?,i4ow848,None,5,"I think you need to bring this to a priest. I personally don't think your confession was invalid because you were actually trying to confess everything, weren't holding anything back, repeated some things several times to make sure you were heard, and truly want to please God. I don't think choosing the older priest was an issue.Im a layperson, just like you, and any other advice on this is not going to be what you need because you are going to try to reason your way into the confession being invalid and will probably go back to confession. If you're scrupulous and have OCD you need a regular confessor who knows about this issue that you can confess to so that your mind will be at ease and he can give you appropriate advice and penances that will help you overcome this. I'm saying this with charity; you really need some help. You're torturing yourself. Talk to your priest and let him know about this and he will be more than happy to help you.EDIT I checked your post history. You need a regular confessor and therapy. Seek out a Cognitave Behavioral Therapist (I see a Catholic one for my ADHD) and he will help you develop real strategies for overcoming these issues (this is different than talk therapy because CBT utilizes the whole body). Your brain is literally addicted to thinking these thoughts and your priest and therapist will help you break this cycle. You don't have to live like this. Peace."
u3fxe7,Was my Easter confession valid?,iasqr8n,SaintBobOfTennessee,4,"The priest does not have to understand every word you say for it to be valid. All he has to hear is that you are confessing your sins, and that you say an act of contrition. If you desired to confess all mortal sins and made a reasonable effort to do so, your confession is valid. Scrupulosity is a spiritual disease promoted by the devil. He wants you to agonize over whether you confessed properly or whether some sin might be mortal or not."
u3fxe7,Was my Easter confession valid?,i4oxz2o,None,3,"Do you know what saint Joanne from Arc said, when they asked her, if she is in the state of grace? You should  meditate her reply.Your comment seems scrupulous. There are always old priests and church never asked them to test if they hear well enough. It seems more probable to me that this was minor sin, next time go to the other priest, so your conscience would be clear.  E. g. at the end of easter octave.To make a mortal sin is harder than scrupulous souls think and is easier than think the lax ones.To make it a grave sin, the choose of the confessor must be more than average significant. For example the bad priest would ""give"" you absolution even if he would know, you do not want to change your sinful life - e. g. manager of abortion house. That would be a grave sin, because he would not normally receive the absolution from other priest.You can look at your case and ask, if the other priest would probably refuse to gave you a confession or not. Do not invent anything special, just look on what is the most probable."

tyw4lm,Entering diocesan churches,i3wy756,JackStone2112,2,"The fact that Catholics are still receiving in the hand is distressing. When will the trials end! This problem is absolutely part of the crisis of the Church and needs to be addressed.  We should keep in mind where our arguments, even valid ones, take us.    Not to enter a Catholic Church on the basis that there may be errant species- lost particles- may be a valid concern, but it leads to counter-productive acts and arguments.  After all, there may be errant species at a chapel where the TLM is said.  I think about the children‚Äôs story *Outlaws of Ravenhurst* where the stain of the spilled Precious Blood is still evident on the Chapel floor- a dramatic consequence of unintended spillage.      Catholics- even some NO Catholics despite the statistics to the contrary- still believe in the Real Presence and would agree that dropping the Eucharist is an unintentionally sacrilegious accident.  Those good Catholics might on that basis be open to an argument that Our Lord should be safely received on the tongue.  But how would I tell them that, or encourage proper reception, if I refuse to even step inside a *Catholic Church*?  I would seem to be erecting a steep wall that really is not necessary.  But I understand the motivation, and depth of concern for Our Lord.  -JMJ-"
tyw4lm,Entering diocesan churches,i3wt7zm,None,1,"I have never heard about anyone thinking that way. I can understand it, but from big picture it does not seem fitting to reality.1) In every church there was always a chance, that you might step on our Lord, but people were going into them. So they did not seen it as problematic. Even in TLM can accidentally be dropped eucharist on the ground, it is less likely, but accidents do happen. There is greater good of you praying in the temple than the risk that there might be some particle. 2) The problem of modern churches is mostly their interior and what happens inside them. If there are some new statues, images etc, they are usually ugly or of low quality. Random pieces of junk or kids art are placed on random places. In 90 % there is the Calvin's table. Often images of people that should have never been canonised - like JPII."
